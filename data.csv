Sadie is a beautiful black swan who lives on the pond with Prince Bertie the Frog. She finds a crown and puts it on her elegant head.,0
"Prince Boris sees her, and believes that she is a princess who has been turned into a swan - in the same way that Prince Bertie was turned into a frog.",0
"One summer’s day, the royal nanny wheeled a push chair from the palace, down the garden path to the pond.",0
The little girl sitting in the chair wore a golden crown on top of her curly head.,0
"Her name was Princess Poppy. When they arrived, Nanny released the little princess from the straps of her push chair and gave her a bag of the day-before-yesterday’s bread.",0
"All the ducks and geese could spot a crumb from a mile away, and they were soon flapping and squawking in front of the princess, and racing and pecking each other.",0
"Sadie, the solitary black swan, sat aloof from the unseemly squabble, and admired the crown on the little princess’ head.",0
"Oh my,",1
"said Sadie out loud to no one in particular,",0
I am so pleased to live on a royal pond.,1
The people who come here are such a cut above!,1
"Princess Poppy began to toddle along the edge of the pond, the royal nanny followed close behind her, tapping on her her mobile phone as she went.",0
The princess clambered up onto a little pier that led out into the water.,0
"The nanny was texting, ""CU @ eight by the bike sheds."" And she did not notice when the princess’ little foot trod on some duck weed.",0
"Prince Bertie the frog saw this and he croaked,",0
Uh oh!,1
Because he knew that the weed was very slippery.,0
"And then, oh dear, she did slip on the weed, and then...",0
Splash!,0
Princess Poppy was in the water.,0
She couldn’t swim and she just went straight down to the bottom like a bomb.,0
"The water wasn’t deep, but it went over the princess’ head.",0
"Bertie dived in after her but he was just a frog, and all he could do was say,",0
Hold your breath little princess!,1
"The nanny, still holding her mobile phone, jumped into the water, and in a few seconds she had pulled the princess up off the bottom of the pond and placed her on the pier.",0
"The princess said,",0
"I’m the king of the castle, and you’re the dirty rascal.",1
Then Colin the carp scooped the crown onto his head and tried it for size.,0
"Now I’m just as important as that snooty His Royal Highness Prince Bertie the Frog,",1
he said.,0
"But after a while, his head began to hurt, so he stopped wearing the crown.",0
"Little Tim the Tadpole said,",0
"Bertie, why don’t you put the crown on?",1
"After all, you’re the only true prince in this pond.",1
"Unfortunately, Bertie couldn’t wear the crown, because although it was size one and a half, just big enough for a small child, it was still too heavy for a frog.",0
"But it did fit just perfectly onto the elegant head of Sadie the Swan. Soon, she was swanning around the pond like a true princess.",0
All the ducklings and goslings gazed at her in admiration.,0
"In a dark corner of the pond, Colin the carp muttered,",0
"It’s bad enough putting up with a frog who thinks he’s a prince, but there’s nothing so annoying as a swan who’s got airs and graces.",1
"And as it happened, Sadie was already wondering if in fact she was a true princess.",0
"Bertie,",1
"she said as she admired her own reflection,",0
"Do you think it’s at all possible that the wicked queen turned me into a swan, just like she turned you into a frog?’ Bertie did not want to disappoint Sadie, so he replied, ",0
"Well, maybe...",1
"Later that day, Prince Boris came down to the pond.",0
"He set up a little chair on the end of the pier, took out a rod, and cast a fishing line into the water.",0
"Bertie warned all the fish to stay away from his hook, even though there was a fat tempting worm on it.",0
Prince Boris had flowing blond locks of hair.,0
"Bertie always considered that he looked like a girl, but the girls all thought he was extremely handsome, and Sadie agreed with them.",0
"She glided over to the pier, and placed herself where he could not fail to notice her.",0
Boris looked at her in amazement.,0
"He had never seen a swan with a crown on her head before, but he had heard tales of beautiful princesses turned into swans.",0
"he said,",0
you are the most beautiful creature I have ever set eyes upon.,1
And Sadie fluttered her feathers with pleasure at the compliment.,0
"You black beauty,",1
he went on.,0
Could it be...,1
could it be that you are a princess?,1
A beautiful African princess.,1
"Why, I’m sure you must be.",1
The wicked queen is always turning people into pondlife.,1
It’s even rumoured that she converted that snotty Prince Bertie into a slug or a toad.,1
He’s certainly not been seen or heard of since she got angry with him.,1
Now listen carefully my darling princess swan.,1
This is the longest day of the year.,1
"Tonight, at sunset, I will come down to the pond, kiss your beautiful red beak, and turn you back into a princess.",1
Wait for me my lovely.,1
But now I must hurry and buy a diamond ring for our engagement.,1
"Till tonight, Adieu!",1
Adieu!,1
"On hearing these words, Sadie almost swooned with excitement.",0
"Don’t listen to him,",1
said Bertie.,0
Boris is a well known love-rat.,1
He always cheated at football.,1
He bullied small princelings.,1
He copied my homework.,1
He tried to pinch Princess Beatrice off me.,1
He has no honour.,1
He’ll stop at nothing.,1
"Sadie, you must listen to me, you can do so much better than Boris!",1
But Sadie didn’t listen to Bertie because she had been swept off her wings and was already dreaming of her royal wedding to Prince Boris the Brave. That evening Sadie was waiting for her prince.,0
She sat in the middle of the pond with her crown glinting red and gold in the dying rays of the sun.,0
"Boris came down to the pond, sat down by the bank, and pulled on some enormous green galoshes that went up above his knees.",0
"Then he started to wade into the the water towards Sadie, but just as he got near, Colin the carp swam under his foot and tripped him up.",0
Boris fell over into the water and emerged spluttering and with green slime in his blond hair.,0
"Bertie laughed, but Sadie did not hear him.",0
"She wanted to say,",0
"Darling, do not worry, for I will love you forever and day, slime and all.",1
Boris stumbled towards her.,0
She gently closed her eyes.,0
"she thought,",0
Now I will be restored to my true self.,1
Princess Sadie.,1
He held her head in his hands and kissed her red beak...,0
And nothing happened.,0
So he kissed her again...,0
And still nothing happened.,0
"Oh bother,",1
"he said, and tried one last time.",0
"But still, Sadie was a Swan.",0
"Ah, terribly sorry,",1
"said Boris,",0
But it seems that you aren’t a princess after all.,1
Just a silly old swan.,1
Well I’m just glad nobody saw this little moonlight escapade.,1
"And with that, he turned around and started to wade back out of the pond.",0
"Oh Sadie,",1
"said Bertie, as he tried to comfort her.",0
I did try to warn you...,1
"but Sadie was disconsolate, which means more than just a bit sad.",0
She didn’t reply.,0
She cast the crown off her head into the water before sliding off to hide in the rushes.,0
"It’s alright for that rat, Boris,",1
she said to herself.,0
None of his friends saw him fall face down in the pond.,1
But all the pond life know what a fool I was made to look.,1
Oh the shame of it!,1
I will never live this down.,1
For two days she stayed put.,0
"Bertie brought her the tastiest slime on the pond, and the best bits of bread from Princess Poppy, but nothing would comfort her.",0
"Until, that is, three days later a handsome black swan came swooping in to land on the pond with a great...",0
Swooooooosh!,0
Sadie poked her head out of the rushes to see who the new arrival was.,0
"Ah,"" she said.",0
He looks rather nice.,0
"I think I’ll pop over and be the first to welcome him to our pond."" And I’m glad to say that very soon she had forgotten all about Prince Boris. But Colin the Carp kept the crown standing outside his home in the rocks on the bottom of the pond, just to show that he was the most important fish in the water.",0
"Download the audio (Right Click, Save As) Katie’s Great Aunt Chloe is coming to stay for Halloween. Unfortunately her Great Aunt always makes Katie embarrassed by being just too",0
witchy.,1
She can’t resist flying on her broomstick and doing other tricks that draw attention to the fact that the family are witches.,0
This story features incidental music by Gabriella and Jay. Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration twenty minutes.,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Hello, this is Natasha, and I’m dropping by with a Halloween Story about our own Katie the Witch. I was just wondering, do you have any relatives that make you feel, well, just a bit embarrassed?",0
"You know, perhaps they dress in bad taste, or dance terribly at parties, or make awful jokes.",0
Katie had a relative a bit like that.,0
"Her name was Great Aunt Chloe, and you can meet her in this story.",0
"The trees were turning golden brown, the squirrels were busy burying conkers in the park, and the witches were getting ready for Halloween. For Katie’s mum, this was the busiest time of the year in her shop called the Magic Lantern. If you wanted to be a classy witch or a snazzy goblin, The Magic Lantern was the place to come and browse for a costume.",0
"Katie helped her mum cut out pumpkins, and at night, when the shop was closed, the door was guarded by ghoulish glowing faces.",0
"In the day, it was packed with mums and kids stocking up for Halloween. Many of them were from Katie’s School, which was holding a Halloween Ball. Jennie’s mum came into the shop to buy some Halloween Lights, and as she was paying she said to Katie’s mum:",0
Of course your daughter doesn’t have to dress up for the Halloween Ball. She can just go as herself.,1
And Katie’s mum fumed because she didn’t think that remark was meant as a compliment.,0
"In fact, Halloween was far from Katie’s favourite time of year.",0
It was the time when nobody would let her forget that she was a witch.,0
Even her best friend Isis asked her:,0
"Katie, what do witches actually do for Halloween?",1
"I mean, they don’t really fly around on broomsticks, right?",1
And Katie replied:,0
Don’t be silly.,1
Of course they don’t.,1
"But actually, that wasn’t strictly true.",0
"Katie knew at least one witch who liked to take her broomstick for a spin on Halloween. And unfortunately, that person was her Great Aunt Chloe. Great Aunt Chloe was the sister of Katie’s Grandma. But she was a very different sort of person.",0
Grandma was extremely polite and proper.,0
"Aunt Chloe, as everyone in the family knew, had been a bit of a wild witch in her youth.",0
She had been the first person to fly around the world on a broomstick.,0
"And she had been a member of The Red Sticks – a team of witches that did formation broom flying and death defying stunts, like loop the loop and vertical take-off.",0
"And although these days she did not do so much flying, she still liked to keep up the tradition on Halloween. People said that she had been extremely beautiful back in the old days, and she still was, in a witchy sort of way.",0
"And although it was good that she was proud of her magical heritage, it could also be a bit embarrassing for Katie and her mum who preferred to keep that sort of thing a bit hush hush.",0
Great Aunt Chloe had invited herself to come and stay.,0
And the time she had picked for her visit was the Halloween weekend.,0
Katie lay awake at night hoping that her Great Aunt would not do anything too embarrassing.,0
But she knew that she probably would.,0
"The school’s Halloween Ball went off just fine for Katie. One or two people – like Jennie and Jake – were nagging her to pull off a magic stunt or two, but most people just said how pretty she looked in her costume.",0
She was wearing a blue and yellow caftan with lots of magical signs embroidered on the collar and cuffs.,0
There was nothing too witchy about it at all.,0
"And everyone loved the pumpkin dance that she performed with Isis. This is how Katie and Isis did the pumpkin dance, to the song:",0
Don’t Be Scared of Halloween.,1
"Firstly, they held their hands out to the side, holding pumpkins in their palms like weighing scales, and they swayed at the waist.",0
"They did a tap step from left to right, then they moved their shoulders up and down, they did a full turn and swivelled their pumpkin hands.",0
"For the verse beginning Witch’s Love to Fly on Sticks, they imagined they were flying on broom sticks, flinging sweets with flicking gestures of their hands.",0
"Later on, when it was dark, the streets were full of excited kids going Trick or Treating. The little ones were all sugared up on sweets and shrieking like demons.",0
The older ones tried to help their parents keep the smaller ones in check.,0
"On the doorsteps of people’s houses, the kids screamed:",0
"Trick or Treat,",1
"and if the people were nice, they gave them sweets.",0
But Katie and Isis collected the best haul of sweets because they charmed everyone with their pumpkin dance.,0
Great Aunt Chloe came along with Katie and her mum.,0
She was wearing a black cloak and a pointed hat with red magical writing on it.,0
"Her eyes were covered with a mask, and she carried her broom stick in her hand.",0
"And although she blended into the general melee of weirdly dressed people, Katie could not help feeling anxious that she might do something just a bit embarrassing.",0
Two small kids ran past chanting:,0
Katie is a witch!,1
Katie is a witch!,1
"And Aunt Chloe said,",0
I don’t think that’s very nice.,1
"Oh I take no notice of little brats like them,",1
said Katie.,0
"They’re only small, and besides, they’ve scoffed too many sweets.",1
Aunt Chloe dismissed them with a shrug.,0
But then one of the kids turned around and threw something at Katie. Isis shrieked.,0
And Katie said:,0
Er what’s that?,1
It was a Goo Bomb – a new kind of nasty toy that exploded with gooy green slime.,0
"Poor Katie was covered in it, and her hair was all sticky.",0
HA HA!,1
Look at the ugly Slimy Witch!,1
shouted the kids.,0
But they weren’t so amused when Great Aunt Chloe raised her arm and pointed a lengthy index finger at them.,0
"No don’t, Aunt Chloe, Please!",1
pleaded Katie. But her Great Aunt was not listening.,0
A green beam shot out of her finger and zapped first one and then the other kid.,0
They both staggered backwards and sat down on a door step.,0
"When they tried to stand up, they couldn’t.",0
They were stuck there.,0
That will teach you to mess with a witch.,1
You can stay on the Naughty Step until I release you ....,1
which might be sometime next week if I am in a good mood.,1
"But on the other hand, I might just fly home and forget all about you.",1
Both the children started to cry and their mothers rushed over and tried to help them to stand.,0
"But try as they might, they couldn’t.",0
"People were staring at Great Aunt Chloe, and Katie, and her mum, and accusations were starting to fly around.",0
What have you done to our children?,1
demanded one of the mums.,0
"And Great Aunt Chloe said,",0
I haven’t done anything.,1
They are just naughty children.,1
They threw goo all over my niece.,1
"Katie was so embarrassed, she wished that the road would open up and swallow her.",0
"Then she remembered that she shouldn’t wish too hard for anything like that because, after all, she was a witch, and it could actually happen.",0
Katie’s mum pulled Chloe away from the crowd.,0
Please Aunt Chloe. Release them at once.,1
"In my day, children knew how to behave,",1
retorted Chloe.,0
"But if you don’t let them go now, there will be a terrible scene and people will boycott my shop and bully Katie at school.",1
"Oh all right then,",1
sighed Chloe. And she muttered the spell to unglue the two terrors from the step.,0
The naughty kids were able to stand.,0
Their parents were hugging them.,0
Nobody was quite sure what had happened.,0
But a few people suspected.,0
Katie was fuming with her Great Aunt as they walked home with a bucket full of sweets.,0
"It’s just awful,",1
she thought.,0
Now all the teasing and taunting about my family of witches is going to start all over again.,1
"She was glum when they got home, and went straight upstairs to sulk on her bed.",0
Her cat Solomon wasn’t there.,0
"I wish he hadn’t gone out tonight,",1
thought Katie.,0
There will be fireworks and they might scare the life out of him.,1
Soon she heard some cracks and bangs in the sky.,0
Oh NO!,1
"exclaimed Katie, and she ran out into the garden.",0
The sound was coming from somewhere up on the roof.,0
"She looked up and saw not Solomon, but Great Aunt Chloe standing astride her broomstick on the tiles.",0
A stream of red stars was pouring out of the back of her stick and she was waving her hat and screeching for all she was worth.,0
"Then she and her broomstick shot up into the sky, not quite vertically, but almost.",0
‘FZZZZZZZSHOOOOWOW!,0
"Wow, that’s cool flying,",1
thought Katie.,0
"But I really really hope the neighbours don’t see, or if they do, that they think she’s a rocket.",1
"Chloe was writing twirly patterns of stars in the sky, and Katie was sure that lots of people must have noticed.",0
She heard,0
oohs,1
from the next door garden – then she ran through the house and out the front and found that a small crowd of people were standing in the street gazing up at the magical display.,0
"That’s some firework,",1
said a bald man.,0
"Impressive,",1
said a woman.,0
Did it come from a back garden?,1
But a little boy said something that Katie didn’t want to hear.,0
That’s not a firework.,1
Fireworks don’t go on for a long time like that.,1
Look it’s a witch!,1
His mother ticked him off:,0
"Don’t be silly, witches only exist in books,",1
but his sister shouted:,0
Yippee I’ve seen a real life witch!,1
Oh Yikes!,1
thought Katie.,0
I’ll never live this down.,1
The bald man started taking pictures with his mobile phone:,0
"I’ll put these on Facebook,",1
he said.,0
"No better still, I’ll take a movie and send it to the TV Station. ‘Witch Flies on Halloween!’ They’ll pay good money for pictures like these.",1
"But then the broom stick started to swoop back down from the moonlit sky – it was coming down really fast, and very steeply – and Katie wondered how her Great Aunt managed to hang on, especially at her age.",0
"But then, she wasn’t hanging on any more – she slid off the stick and was dangling by one arm.",0
Katie put her hands to her face:,0
I can’t bear to look anymore,1
she said.,0
But through a chink in her fingers she saw her Great Aunt come tumbling off her stick and fall down somewhere into the park.,0
Katie screamed,0
AAAHH THAT’S MY Aunt!,1
and people stared at her.,0
She was too alarmed to care.,0
She was running down the road to the entrance to the park.,0
"The gate was locked, but she managed to vault over it with a quick little weight-defying spell that made her bound like she was on the moon.",0
"She wasn’t quite sure where her Great Aunt had landed, but she thought that she must have broken every bone in her body.",0
"Then, as she got near the lake, she had another fright.",0
A weird creature was wading through the water.,0
Katie froze.,0
"Could it be,",1
"she thought,",0
some kind of ghoul that wakes up on Halloween?,1
– but of course it wasn’t a ghoul – it was her Great Aunt who had landed in the pond.,0
YEE-HA!,1
she called.,0
Did you see me fly Katie?,1
Just like the old days.,1
Only I seem to have broken my broom.,1
Pity. I’ve had that one since way back when.,1
They don’t make ‘em like that anymore.,1
"The next day, Isis sent Katie a link to a video on YouTube. It showed a Halloween Witch flying over the rooftops amid the fireworks and crashing.",0
Only most of the comments were agreed on one thing:,0
NICE FAKE!,1
This was one of the good things about magic.,0
"If people don’t believe in it, they will think it’s just trickery when they see it.",0
"When Katie got to school on Monday, nobody was teasing her.",0
Emma even said:,0
I wish I had a Great Aunt like yours.,1
She was really cool in her costume.,1
All my relatives are so boring they are just embarrassing.,1
"At first Katie thought,",0
"If only my relatives were boring, I’d be so glad.",1
And then she realised:,0
"Yes, people are often a bit embarrassed about their family – but usually there is no need, because other people see them quite differently.",1
"But all the same, she was glad that Halloween was over, and that her Great Aunt Chloe had flown home safely on a new broom stick that couldn’t go nearly as fast as the old one.",0
"And that was the story of Katie’s Halloween Aunt. Before I go, I’d like to let you know that Storynory is now putting some books on Kindle, to see if people would like to read our stories that way.",0
"Check out the Kindle store on Amazon for our story Katie and the Witch’s Swap, as well as some others we’ve put up there.",0
"And just in case you don’t know – you can download the Kindle app for computers and mobile phones, as well as the Kindle device.",0
And Storynory has a new Katie song out.,0
"It’s all about Katie and it’s called,",0
Don’t be Scared of Halloween.,1
"It’s sung by our very own Gabriella, so do go to Storynory.com where you can download the mpthree for free!",0
"For now, from me, Natasha Bye Bye!",0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration twenty-two.fifty-one.,0
Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. It was December. Jason and his family were in the Airport. The loud speaker announced:,0
"Last call for Flight IC three hundred and seventy-seven to Reykjavik. All passengers due to board this flight, please make your way to departure gate forty-two.",1
And Dad said:,0
Bags of time yet.,1
I still need some duty-frees.,1
And Mum said:,0
Just wait here while I pop to the loo.,1
And Jason waited.,0
"And when Mum and Dad both finally got back, they all had to run to catch the plane.",0
They were the last on board –,0
as usual,1
"– thought Jason. When eventually they were in the air above the grey clouds of London, Mum said to him:",0
What a sad face you have?,0
Aren’t you excited to be spending Christmas in Iceland?,0
Why there’s ice and snow guaranteed – and volcanos too....,0
"Well yes,",1
"said Jason,",0
But what?,1
asked Dad,0
But Santa doesn’t go to Iceland does he?,1
said Jason.,0
What’s the point of spending Christmas in the one country where Santa doesn’t visit.,1
"Even if there’s ice and snow and volcanoes, Christmas isn’t any use without Santa.",1
Mum and Dad both laughed.,0
"Why of course he visits iceland,",1
said Dad.,0
It’s practically next door to where he lives.,1
It’s his very first stop on his round-the-world tour every Christmas.,1
Jason tried to look cheerful:,0
Is that all right then?,1
"asked Dad,",0
because you don’t look completely convinced.,1
And Jason said:,0
Don’t believe every bit of idle gossip you hear in the playground.,1
Why would Santa not want to go to Iceland?,1
His reindeer love ice and snow.,1
It’s hot places like Australia that they find difficult.,1
"And even though Jason knew that Dad wasn’t always right about everything, he decided to believe him this time, because what he said sounded like it was true.",0
"And by the time they landed, he was feeling excited about Christmas in Iceland. And it was true that Iceland was an amazing place.",0
"They stayed with Dad’s old University friend – whose name was Magnus. He lived on his own in Reykjavik, which is the capital, and he even though he was Dad’s age, he seemed quite young and friendly, and he quite often said funny or interesting things.",0
"He told them that by law, all Icelandic houses must be built strong enough to withstand earthquakes.",0
"And all the hot water in Icelandic homes came straight out the ground, already hot.",0
And sometimes farmers would dig up potatoes in the fields that were already cooked.,0
"And Magnus and his girlfriend took Jason and his family out for drives and walks to see frozen lakes, icy glaziers, and bright red streams of boiling lava from the volcanos.",0
"At that time of year, the sun only rose at elevenam in the morning – and it set by fourpm in the afternoon.",0
"But sometimes when they were really lucky, they saw great beams of green, yellow and blue light that curved round the sky like giant flames – and those were the famous Northern Lights. They were fantastic – one hundred times better than fireworks on bonfire night.",0
"But it was only after they had been there a couple of days, that Jason remembered to ask Magnus if it was true that Santa really did visit Iceland. They were just finishing dinner, and Jason’s mum laughed:",0
He’s been ever so worried because somebody told him at school that Santa doesn’t come here.,1
And Magnus looked very grave and said:,0
That’s right.,1
He doesn’t.,1
And Jason felt the blood run cold out of his cheeks and he thought he might be sick.,0
"Oh, don’t joke about Santa,",1
said Mum.,0
Jason’s deadly serious about him.,1
"I’m not joking,",1
"said Magnus,",0
"but don’t worry Jason, because we are very lucky here.",1
"We have thirteen little Imps who do Santa’s work for him – and if you are interested, I’ll tell you the story.",1
"And Jason was very interested, because he thought Magnus was good at telling stories.",0
And this is what Magnus told them:,0
"A long time ago, when Santa first got into the toy business, he set up his factory in the mountains of Iceland. He married an Icelandic girl called Gryla, and they had thirteen sons – all Impish boys – who used to help them in the factory.",0
"And they also had a black cat, who grew and grew until he was simply enormous.",0
For a while Santa was very happy.,0
"Every Christmas, children would make their way up to his special toy shop, and Santa and Gryla would hand out presents.",0
"But one Christmas Day, when Santa finished work, he went to look in the kitchen cupboard for something warming to drink.",0
"And to his surprise, he found that the door to the cupboard was locked.",0
"And as he shook and rattled the door, he heard a sound from within, – something like children crying.",0
Santa always had a hammer and chisel in his belt for making toys – and he took those out and broke the lock on the door.,0
"And inside the cupboard, he found six little children, who shrank back in terror from him.",0
"Yo, ho ho,",1
he said.,0
Don’t be frightened.,1
"It’s only me, Santa, and I like little children.",1
"You like us for dinner, you mean,",1
said one little girl.,0
Perish the thought!,1
"No, no no.",1
"I like to make toys and bring them to children as presents,",1
he said.,0
Even naughty children get a present from Santa – and don’t believe anyone who tells you different.,1
"And gradually the children came out of the cupboard, and explained that they had come to the factory for their christmas presents, – but they had been caught like mice by a giant black cat, who had picked them up by their collars brought them to this cupboard.",0
"Then Santa’s wife, Gryla,  had locked the door and said that they would be served for Christmas dinner because they had been naughty children.",0
"And when Santa heard this story, at first he didn’t believe them because it was so terrible – but then Gryla came into the kitchen and was furious with him for sneaking into the cupboard and letting their Christmas dinner escape before she had a chance to cook it.",0
"Too bad,",1
said Dad.,0
You should have done your homework better.,1
Now you’re getting potatoes for Christmas.,1
That’s Rubbish!,1
said Jason.,0
I don’t believe in those Imps. It’s just your idea of a joke.,1
You told Magnus to make up that silly story.,1
But Magnus swore that it was a true story.,0
"And he said that that night, they would be visited by Stubby, who liked to drink warm milk.",0
"So they left some warm milk out for Stubby, and Jason again put his shoes on the window sill.",0
"And in the morning, the warm milk was gone and inside his shoe Jason found – A bar of chocolate.",0
And Jason ate the chocolate.,0
But it he still didn’t believe the story about the thirteen Christmas Imps. He thought it was just Dad and Magnus playing a trick on him.,0
"And the following night, Magnus said that they would be visited by Itty Bitty,and that he was very small and would sneak into the kitchen like a mouse and steal any crumb that he could find.",0
"And in the morning, Magnus said he was sure that Itty Bitty had been and had nibbled some cheese and biscuits.",0
"And in his shoe, Jason found – a toy car.",0
He liked the car.,0
"But he still didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And the following night, Magnus said that they would be visited by Pot Scraper, who was extremely thin, and was so hungry that he would steal any left-overs or scraps.",0
"And instead of clearing away his plate after dinner, Magnus left it on the table, and in the morning it was licked clean.",0
"And next to his shoe, Jason found a book about famous footballers – he read the book, – but still he didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And the following night, Magnus said that they would be followed by Bowl Licker. And he left out a red wooden bowl that his girlfriend had used to make a chocolate cake.",0
And in the morning it was licked clean.,0
"And next to his shoes, Jason found a little wooden helicopter with blades that went round by solar power.",0
"He had seen one of those when he had been out shopping with Mum in London – and he remembered how Mum had said what a great idea it was to learn about renewable energy – and he reckoned that she had brought it with her to Iceland. And although he thought the solar-powered helicopter was interesting, he still didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And the following night Magnus said that they would be visited by Door Slammer. And while Jason lay in bed.",0
"he heard all the doors in the house slamming, one by one – and it was really creepy.",0
But he thought it was just Dad and Magnus playing a trick.,0
"And in the morning, beside his shoe, he found a DVD of Kung Fu Panda. And he watched the DVD, but still he didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And the following Night Magnus said that they would be visited by Skyr Gobbler. He explained that Skry liked yoghurt.",0
And so he left some out for the Imp. And in the morning it was gone.,0
"And beside his shoe, Jason found – a racing car set, with tracks, and electric stunt cars that could loop the loop in mid air.",0
And Jason though that the present was really cool.,0
"But still he didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And that night, Magnus said that they would be visited by Sausage Snatcher, who was really old and wrinkly, and whose face was dirty and sooty.",0
He was good at climbing into the rafters of the house where in the old days they used to hang sausages.,0
And so Magnus left a sausage up in the loft for him.,0
"And in the morning, the sausage was gone.",0
"And in his shoe, Jason found - A tangerine.",0
And Jason ate the tangerine.,0
"But he still didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps. And that night, Magnus said that they would be visited by Window Peeper. He said that he would be looking through the windows to see what he could steal.",0
So he left out some chocolates on the table.,0
"And that night, as he lay in bed, Jason heard a noise at the window.",0
"And he got up and drew the curtain, and expected to see Dad or Magnus. But instead he saw a huge black cat.",0
"It’s green eyes stared at him, and then it disappeared into the shadows.",0
Jason thought that was rather creepy.,0
"And in the morning, the chocolates were gone, and by his shoes, Jason found - Two tickets to a West-End show.",0
And Dad said that the Imp must have left them for Mum. So Jason gave them to her and she was really pleased.,0
But still Jason’ didn’t believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps – because how would they know that Mum wanted to see,0
Love-Story on Ice?,1
"And that night, Magnus said that they would be visited by Doorway Sniffer. He liked to hang around by the kitchen door, sniffing for the smell of fresh bread.",0
So he left a loaf of crusty bread on the table.,0
And in the morning it was gone.,0
"And by his shoe Jason found - A large deer-stalker hat, and Dad said that the Imp must have left it for him, and he was really pleased.",0
"But still Jason did not believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps, because how would they know that Dad had terrible taste in clothes?",0
"And that night Magnus said that they would be visited by Meat Hooker, who liked to dangle a hook down the chimney and catch any ham or fish that was smoking there.",0
"Magnus didn’t have a chimney, but he left a lamb chop out on the kitchen table for him, and in the morning it was gone.",0
"And in his left shoe, Jason found - A sixteen Gigabyte Mpthree player – and he thought that was pretty cool.",0
But still he wasn’t sure about the Christmas Imps – because how would they know that he had asked Santa for an MPthree player?,0
"And that night would be Christmas Eve. And Magnus said that they would be visited by the last of the Imps, whose name was Candle Snatcher, and he liked to steal light bulbs, and so he left a fifty watt bulb on the kitchen table for him.",0
And Jason thought that he would finally prove that the thirteen Imps didn’t exist.,0
"He would get up in the night, hide by the kitchen door, and catch Dad or Magnus red-handed as they stole the light bulb off the table.",0
And so that night he stayed awake.,0
"And when it was really, really late he reached over to turn on the lamp by his bed – but it didn’t switch on.",0
"That’s strange,",1
he thought.,0
The bulb must have broken.,0
"He crept onto the landing, and down the stairs, and as he was next to the kitchen door, he heard a noise from within.",0
"I bet that’s one of them stealing the light bulb,",1
he said.,0
And so he jumped through the door and shouted,0
Caught you!,1
as he flicked the switch of the kitchen light.,0
But no light came on.,0
And it was dark inside the kitchen.,0
Magnus?,1
Is that you?,1
he asked.,0
But there was no reply.,0
Just then the sky through the kitchen window turned pale green and the room filled with an eery light.,0
"And by the kitchen table, he saw a little figure.",0
"It had a strange, yellow face, with bright cat-like eyes- and pointy ears.",0
In its hand it held a light bulb.,0
"The figure started to float upwards and backwards without moving its feet, and in a moment or two it had vanished through the glass of the window – even though it was tripple-glazed and firmly shut.",0
And in the morning there was nothing by Jason’s shoe.,0
But he did believe in the thirteen Christmas Imps.,0
"But Katie discovers that True Love must come from the heart, not from a magic spell.",0
And if you like Valentine stories try:,0
"Read by Natasha. Duration seventeen Minutes.  Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Katie went to a nice school where most of the teachers were kind, but some of them were quite strict, and all of them could be moody and grumpy at times, just like anyone else can be.",0
"Unfortunately, Katie’s form teacher was more grumpy and more moody than most, and more often.",0
She was the only teacher in the whole school who the children hadn’t given a nick name to.,0
"For instance, Mr Philpots was known as Potty, which seemed to suit him quite well.",0
"Mrs Woodruff was called dandruff, and Miss Tidy was called Untidy because she was.",0
Katie’s teacher was called Miss Vile. That was her real name.,0
"So she didn’t have a nickname, because quite frankly, she didn’t need one.",0
Katie!,1
she said one morning.,0
This homework looks like it was done in about five minutes.,1
You know that you are meant to spend at least half an hour on it.,1
You will stay in at playtime and do it again.,1
Katie!,1
she said another time.,0
Those tights are not regulation school uniform.,1
"I will call your mother, she must take you home, and you must change them.",1
And Katie!,1
she said yet another time.,0
Stop muttering to yourself.,1
You know that magic spells are against the school rules.,1
When anybody misbehaved Miss Vile wrote their names up on a board called,0
The Wall of Shame.,1
"Everyone’s name was on it, except for Samantha’s and Matthew’s, because they were both goody-two-shoes who never did anything wrong.",0
But Katie’s name was written on The Wall of Shame more than anybody else’s.,0
"In fact, it was written right at the top of the board in large red letters with ten exclamation marks after it.",0
Katie didn’t feel ashamed.,0
But she did feel cross because it wasn’t fair.,0
"It was the end of January. Katie’s form was learning about the Chinese New Year, and how each year is named after an animal.",0
"Miss Vile asked Katie what was her Chinese symbol, and she said that she was born in the Year of the Cat, and then Miss Vile told her that that was impossible, because there wasn’t a Year of  the Cat, and Katie said:",0
"It’s possible for me because I’m a witch, and all witches are born in the Year of the Cat.",1
"And the whole class laughed, but Isis said:",0
That’s right Miss Vile. Katie’s different because she is a witch.,1
What utter clap-trap!,1
exclaimed Miss Vile.,0
I’ve told you before not to talk nonsense about magic and witches.,1
You will go and see the head teacher right now!,1
Both of YOU!,1
And take this note with you to explain all about your naughtiness!,1
"And while Katie and Isis were waiting to see the head teacher, they both felt very sad and wondered what they could do about Miss Vile.",0
Couldn’t you turn her into a toad or something?,1
asked Isis. But Katie shook her head.,0
"If Miss Vile suddenly turned up to school one day as a toad, everyone would know who was to blame, and I would be in a huge heap of trouble.",0
I might even get expelled for turning a teacher into a toad.,0
And then the Head Teacher called Katie and Isis into her study.,0
"She read the note, and shook her head.",0
"But she wasn’t too cross, because she knew all about Katie.",0
"I know that you are a bit different,",1
"she said to Katie,",0
"and that you can do all sorts of magic spells, but it’s best not to mention it to anybody, ok?",1
Some things are best kept a secret.,1
Now go back to your lessons both of you.,1
"Katie and Isis didn’t see much point in hurrying back to the class, and so they both sat in the cloak room and talked over the problem of Miss Vile.",0
"Well if you can’t turn her into something horrid, maybe you can turn her into something nice,",1
said Isis. And Katie thought about this.,0
"But she couldn’t imagine Miss Vile being anything nice, and she thought that the magic wouldn’t work.",0
I’ve got it!,1
said Isis.,0
It will be Valentine’s Day soon.,1
Why don’t you make her fall in love?,1
"Grown-ups are always in a happy mood when they are in love, and she’ll be nice and kind to us.",1
"Katie thought that was a brilliant idea, because witches know all sorts of magic spells for making people fall in love.",0
But there was only one question.,0
Who with?,0
"Why with Potty of course,",1
"said Isis,",0
He hasn’t got a wife.,1
"Why don’t you make him send her flowers and chocolate, and then she’ll be dancing on air.",1
"Katie and Isis both had a fit of giggles, and when they got back to class everyone wondered why they were both looking so happy after a visit to the Head Teacher’s study.",0
"At home that evening, Katie opened up her mother’s book of spells and turned the pages to",0
"for Love. There were loads and loads of spells, but some of them were a bit impractical.",0
"For instance, if she followed one spell she would need to get hold of some big toe nail clippings from Mr Philpots and a lock of hair from Miss Vile. That didn’t sound very easy.",0
"For another spell, she needed some mandrake’s root from the magic grocery shop, and mandrake’s root was very expensive.",0
"And then she found a spell that just required pictures of the two people who were to fall in love, and that was easy because she had a photograph of the whole school from the end of summer term.",0
"It was a shame that she had to cut it up with a pair of scissors, but it was in a good cause.",0
"On February the fourteenth, which as everyone knows is Valentine’s day, Miss Vile came into class looking quite different.",0
Isis said afterward that she looked like she was lightly tripping on air.,0
"When they saw her, Katie and Isis both felt sure that she had found a box of chocolates, a bunch of red roses and a card next to her locker in the staff room.",0
"Miss Vile. I’m really sorry, but I didn’t have time to do my home work last night.",1
The whole class went silent and you could have heard a drawing pin drop.,0
But Miss Vile said:,0
Never mind Katie. It wasn’t very important anyway.,1
And everyone gasped.,0
And then Katie said:,0
"Actually, I was just joking.",1
I did do it really!,1
And Miss Vile smiled and said.,0
"Ah yes, that’s a funny joke.",1
You got me there.,1
And everyone was totally amazed.,0
I mean like gobsmacked.,0
And Katie smiled to herself.,0
She knew that her spell had worked.,0
"But what Katie didn’t know was that Miss Vile had not just received one box of chocolates, and one bunch of flowers that morning.",0
No. She had received two of each!,0
And two Valentine’s Day cards.,0
No wonder she was in such a good mood.,0
"That evening, Isis and her mum were out shopping in town, and Isis saw Potty and Miss Vile standing outside a restaurant window and looking at the menu.",0
And Isis said to her mum:,0
Look!,1
How romantic!,1
Our teachers are going out for a candle-lit dinner on St. Valentine’s day!,1
And her mum thought that Isis was getting very grown up to make a remark like that.,0
My oh my.,1
Just look at the price of steak and chips at this place.,1
Let’s find somewhere cheaper.,1
"But because Miss Vile was in love, she didn’t think that her dear Potty was stingy.",0
"No, she thought how clever he was to be careful with money, and what a good husband he would make.",0
"For the rest of term, Miss Vile was as sweet as could be, but when the children came back for the summer term, they were in for a big disappointment.",0
Her first words were:,0
The first person who so much as whispers will be picking up litter after school for the rest of term.,1
And Katie and Isis both knew that she Miss Vile must have fallen out of love.,0
Katie was disappointed because it seemed that her spell had not worked entirely as it was supposed to.,0
And so she asked her mother whether the love spell using pictures was any good.,0
"She was careful to explain that it wasn’t for her, but for somebody else.",0
And her mother said:,0
"Love spells work, but only for a while.",1
"It’s only True Love that lasts for ever, not magic love.",1
True Love must come from the heart.,1
"And when Katie heard that, she understood that it wasn’t her fault that the spell hadn’t lasted.",0
And when she told Isis about this they both felt a bit down.,0
But at least they only had one more term with Miss Vile – and after the summer holidays they would have a new form teacher.,0
And Miss Vile was her old grumpy moody self for the next five weeks.,0
"But then after the half term holiday, everyone had a pleasant surprise.",0
She was back to being lovely and carefree.,0
"Katie, did you put another spell on her?",1
asked Isis. But Katie hadn’t.,0
No what had happened was that Mr Cotton had worked up the courage to ask Miss Vile to go to the opera with him.,0
Mr Cotton had two nicknames.,0
One was,0
Socks,1
as in,0
cotton socks,1
and the other was,0
Mr Rotten.,1
"But the second name was unfair, because Mr Cotton was the sweetest and kindest teacher in the whole school.",0
And now Mr Cotton and Miss Vile had found their True Love. Text Copyright Hugh Fraser two thousand and nine.,0
"Football fans, at last here’s a story for you!",0
This story is set at the local football stadium.,0
"We are talking here about the beautiful game which the world plays – not the USA sort of football – sorry Storynory listeners in America, we love you, but we only understand this type of football.",0
"Yes, if you enjoy funny action packed and slightly silly stories, you will love this.",0
"Our hero, who is unjustly wanted by the police, is once again solving a crime.",0
Could it be that the matches at the local football stadium are fixed?,0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Bertie says – on the controversial subject of sound effects, I felt we couldn’t have a story about a football match without some crowd sounds.",0
It just seemed like an obvious thing to include.,0
"We have done our best to make sure that the FX don’t clash with Natasha’s voice, and they only come in towards the end.",0
We hope you will think we’ve struck the right balance this time.,0
"Hello, This is Natasha, and this is a story about somebody we haven’t heard from for quite a while – Theo the crime-fighting monkey.",0
Deep in the archives of Storynory.com – on the Original Stories Page – you will find some tales about a monkey who stands up for justice.,0
"When we left him last, he had escaped from the zoo and the clutches of his arch enemy, Mr Grabber, who is always up to some no good criminal tricks.",0
"In the early days after Theo escaped from the zoo, he was spotted all over the city.",0
Sometimes a child would point from a push-chair and say:,0
"Look, look Mummy, there’s a monkey swinging on a street light!",1
Look Mummy!,1
"And Mummy would say,",0
"Not now dear, I’m on the phone,",1
before adding:,0
"Oh my gosh, that monkey looks quite real!",1
And her friend on the phone would say:,0
"Hey that sounds like the vigilante monkey,",1
"because that was what the papers called Theo. Less often, because it was more dangerous from the point of view of being caught by the police, Theo would get on his motorbike and weave in and out of the traffic.",0
That really would cause a racket.,0
The drivers would hoot their horns as they saw him whizz past.,0
"Eventually you would hear sirens wailing and the police would give chase, but Theo was too quick and too agile, and knew how to escape through the narrow gaps between the cars.",0
"You may recall that Theo had stolen the bike from Mr Grabber, the head zoo keeper, but that was okay, because Mr Gabber was a criminal.",0
"Now that Theo was a free monkey, he could do all sorts of things that he had always wanted to do, like going to the play ground and to try out all the swings and climbing frames, or joining in a game of football in the park.",0
"Kids were always happy for him to play in goal because he was able to swing, jump and dive for the ball better than anyone they had ever seen.",0
He found that he liked football quite a lot.,0
"When there was a big match on at the  stadium, Theo would be sitting up somewhere on the roof of the North Stand, cheering on the city’s home team with cries of:",0
Oooooo ...,1
oooooo ....,1
AAAh...,1
AAAHH.,1
He became so well known that some of the supporters started to dress up in monkey suits.,0
When he chanted they would join in and bang drums and blow trumpets.,0
Somebody gave Theo an orange and blue scarf and a woolly hat to match the team’s colours.,0
"The season started well for City, and they were in second place in their league, chasing promotion up to the top division.",0
But not every game went their way.,0
They lost the quarter final of the Planet TV Knock-Out-Cup on penalties.,0
"And in a Derby match against their arch-rivals, the Rovers, their goalie missed a crucial save by a finger tip.",0
Oooooooh he should have got that one!,1
howled Theo from up on the roof of the stand.,0
And not one of City’s supporters would have disagreed with their monkey mascot.,0
"At every football match, there is always an army of policemen on the streets outside the stadium to keep order among the crowds.",0
"As Theo was a most-wanted ape, after the final whistle went, he used to hang around the stands for a while until the police had gone.",0
"He liked jumping over the now empty seats and on this occasion he even hopped onto the pitch, and swung from the goal posts.",0
"If only I had been in goal, I bet I could have saved that shot,",1
he thought.,0
And then we would have won two-one instead of getting a measly draw.,1
"While he was hanging thoughtfully by one arm, an athletic young man in a tracksuit came out of the players’ tunnel and started jogging towards him.",0
Theo recognised him as the team captain.,0
"Hey, Mr Monkey, the manager wants to meet you,",1
called out the captain.,0
"Theo wondered if this was a police-setup, but curiosity got the better of his animal brain.",0
"When he started to follow, the captain said reassuringly:",0
No need to worry.,1
We all love you as our monkey mascot.,1
Nobody here is going to turn you over to the cops.,1
"First they went to meet the players, who all cheered him when he came into the changing room and they crowded round to pat his hairy head.",0
"Then Theo and the captain went up to the Manager’s office, which had a big glass window overlooking the pitch.",0
"The manager was a heavy-set man with lank grey hair, shifty little eyes, and a red jowly face.",0
"He did not really look like he belonged to the world of sport at all, but in his youth he had played with distinction on the pitch.",0
Ah Theodore,1
", said the manager as the ape came into his office.",0
He was one of the few people who called the fugitive monkey by his real name these days.,0
What’s your poison?,1
"Tea, water..",1
champaign?,1
Theo pointed to the jug of water.,0
"You understand English, of course?",1
Theo nodded.,0
"He helped himself to a piece of sugary Turkish Delight from a box on the table, and swivelled to and fro on the chair.",0
The manager waved his hand.,0
"Okay, you can leave us now, Joey.",1
And the captain went out.,0
Now the Manager and the monkey were alone together.,0
"‘Good match, eh?",0
Pity about that last goal.,0
ooooh–aahhh,1
as he relived the excruciating moment when the shot that should have been saved slipped past the goal line.,0
"I’ll come straight to the point,",1
"said the Manager, leaning across the table:",0
"Football is a game of ninety minutes and two sides who go out to give their utmost, because that’s what we owe to the fans.",1
"At the end of the day, there are only three outcomes, either you win, or you lose or you draw.",1
"There’s no secret about winning – you need eleven players out there on the pitch, and to speak frankly, today there were only ten.",1
"Theo, who was not used to football-manager-speak, found this all hard to follow and he scratched his head.",0
"You don’t get what I’m driving at, do you?",1
"– What I’m saying, in plain monkey-talk, is – Robbie our goalie let that last one in on purpose.",1
There’s no other explanation for it.,1
And Theo suddenly understood exactly what he was talking about.,0
He jumped up and down in his seat and made apish sounds to show that he was in full agreement.,0
"Yeah, glad you’re seeing what I’m seeing,",1
said the Manager.,0
"Now the papers say you are a crime fighting monkey, a sort of private detective, right?",1
Well I want to hire you and I’ll pay you in bananas or whatever food you want for so long as I’m Manager here.,1
All you’ve got to do is take this video recorder,1
– he opened up a drawer and pulled out a compact little machine –,0
and get the evidence.,1
You can do that right?,1
As sure as nuts are nuts – this was the job for Theo. There was nothing that he wanted more than to prove that the goalie had deliberately thrown the match.,0
Theo left right away to start work.,0
"There was no time to lose, as the players would soon be leaving.",0
"He perched on his motorbike, just outside the car park, and waited for Robbie the goalie in his yellow Porsche. As the slippery fingered sportsman drove out with a roar of his engine and a screech of his tyres, Theo released the clutch on his bike.",0
"He had to keep some distance behind the Porsche so as not to be seen, but fortunately it was a dark and rainy evening and visibility was poor.",0
"The sleek yellow car revved impatiently at traffic lights and cut arrogantly in front of other vehicles, but Theo had no problem keeping up.",0
"In fact, they were heading for a part of town that he knew only too well.",0
It was the region north of the park where the zoo was.,0
Could it really be?,1
Could it really be?,1
"thought Theo. But in truth, he wasn’t so surprised when the Porsche pulled up outside the gates of the zoo.",0
"After all most of the big crimes in the city led back to one man – Mr Grabber, Theo’s former keeper.",0
"Theo knew all the ins and outs of the zoo’s perimeter wall, and it was an easy matter for him to be waiting in the shadows near the head keeper’s office by the time the goalie arrived.",0
He had his camera against the window as he saw the men meet and chat on friendly and familiar terms – you might say that they were two of a kind – a zoo keeper and a goal keeper – both as slippery as each other.,0
Theo filmed Mr Grabber counting out a large sum of money and handing it over to the goalie.,0
"Finally, I’ve nailed you both!",1
he thought.,0
He could almost cry with joy!,0
He had the proof that Mr Grabber was paying the goal keeper to throw the match.,0
"He could not understand why, in his monkey brain, anyone would want to do that, but he knew that it was wrong.",0
"Little did he know that Mr Grabber was running an international betting ring, and that there were even bigger sums of money at stake for those who could correctly predict the result of the match and the final positions in the football league.",0
"That night, at his hideaway in the park, Theo could hardly sleep.",0
He was so excited.,0
He was due to meet the football Manager on Monday morning at the stadium.,0
"He would hand over the video he had taken, and surely the police would have all the evidence they needed to arrest both the goalie and Mr Grabber. But it did not quite work out that way.",0
"Theo was again sitting with the Manager, who had now had the video recording, but far from being overjoyed, he let out a long whistle as he played the tape.",0
"Then he got up, and stood with his hands in his pockets, looking out of the big window at the players who were training on the pitch.",0
Eventually he sighed and said:,0
"You’ve done well my son, or should I say, my monkey.",1
"But Theo was puzzled, because he had been expecting him to whoop with triumph.",0
"Now I really have got a plateful of problems,",1
he said.,0
"If the fans get to know that our matches have been fixed, there will be no end of trouble for the club.",1
We’ll have to hush this one up.,1
"I’d just love to drop Robbie like a stone, but our reserve keeper has strained his back.",1
What shall I do?,1
"Take that as a rhetorical question, seeing as you’re a monkey of course.",1
No need to answer.,1
But in fact Theo did have the solution in the palm of his paw – if only they would let him put his plan into action.,0
"A few minutes later, he left the Manager’s office with a rucksack full of fruit, but instead of skipping off home, he went down to the pitch where the players were practicing corner kicks.",0
"The goalie was making some good saves, but of course he was always great in training.",0
"The players stopped to laugh as Theo bounded onto the grass, and jumped up to swing from the crossbar of the goal.",0
"The trainer blew his whistle and waved for the monkey to leave, but Theo turned and bore his teeth at Robbie with an angry snarl.",0
"Oooh, err, he looks like he might bite me,",1
"said the keeper, who stepped away.",0
"I think he wants a go in goal,",1
laughed the captain.,0
"Well since we can’t shift him, we might as well play on,",1
said the trainer and blew his whistle.,0
"The winger booted the ball in from the corner, and one of the mid-fielders headed it towards the top corner of the net.",0
"He was sure it would go in, especially as the keeper was sulking away from his goal mouth.",0
But he wasn’t counting on a hairy foot that swung over in trice and kicked the ball clear.,0
Good save APE!!,1
called out the captain.,0
The team tried another corner.,0
This time Theo caught the ball with a dive.,0
"Robbie wouldn’t have got a finger to that one,",1
said the right back.,0
The players thought this was all a great lark and a break from the routine of Monday morning training.,0
"But up in his office, the Manager was watching everything from his window, and he was taking it all very seriously indeed.",0
"The following Saturday, City were playing away and they lost by a single goal.",0
"Theo did not see the match, but he suspected that both Robbie and Mr Grabber were richer for it.",0
The next week they were playing back at home again.,0
"When the team was announced, a mystery name was among the reserves – Theo Simian. Some of the fans realised that this must be the side’s notorious monkey mascot, and they thought that he was included merely as an apish jape.",0
There were loud cheers when they saw their favourite ape bounding up and down the side of the pitch in an orange and white shirt.,0
"The stadium speakers played the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys song:",0
Hey Hey we are the monkeys,1
and there were cries from the crowd of ,0
THEEEEE-OOO-OOOOh!!!,0
Woooooooh,1
the keeper was flying to meet the ball with his hairy arms outstretched.,0
His strong claw nicked the sacred sphere and deflected its flight path.,0
"In an instant, the boos gave way to cheers.",0
Despondency turned to joy.,0
There was celebration in the home stands.,0
The atmosphere was electric.,0
The chants of,0
Theeee–ooooo,1
were louder than thunder.,0
The players hugged one another.,0
Even the losing side had to give it up for the monkey who saved the match.,0
This is a RATHER SCARY STORY. Children and adults might be a touch frightened by Natasha’s rendering of the wicked witch who wants to cook little Hansel and Gretel. But they will also be enraptured by Hansel and Gretel’s ingenuity as they triumph over evil.,0
"This version of the classic story by The Brothers Grimm is from the Blue Fairy Book of Andrew Lang, published in one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-nine.",0
Read by Natasha. Duration twenty-three minutes.,0
ONCE upon a time there dwelled on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children;,0
"the boy was called Hansel, and the girl Gretel. He always had little enough to live on, and once, when times were bad, they had to get by with one piece of bread and butter each.",0
"One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife,",0
What’s to become of us?,1
"How are we to feed our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?",1
"I’ll tell you what, husband,",1
"answered the woman,",0
early tomorrow morning we’ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood.,1
There we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread;,1
then we’ll go on to our work and leave them alone.,1
"They won’t be able to find their way home, and we shall be rid of them.",1
"No, wife,",1
"said her husband,",0
that I won’t do;,1
how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood?,1
The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.,1
"You fool,",1
"said she,",0
"then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and saw the boards for our coffins.",1
"They argued and argued, until he agreed that they must get rid of Hansel and Gretel.",0
"But I can’t help feeling sorry for the poor children,",1
added the husband.,0
"The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father.",0
"Gretel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel,",0
Now it’s all up with us.,1
"No, no, Gretel,",1
"said Hansel,",0
don’t fret yourself;,1
"I’ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear.",1
"When the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out.",0
"The moon was shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver.",0
Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in.,0
"Then he went back and said to Gretel,",0
"Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep.",1
"God will not desert us,",1
and he lay down in bed again.,0
"At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children,",0
"Get up, you lie-abeds, we’re all going to the forest to fetch wood.",1
"She gave them each a bit of bread and said,",0
"There’s something for your luncheon, but don’t you eat it up beforehand, for it’s all you’ll get.",1
"Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.",0
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.,0
"After they had walked a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this manoeuvre he repeated again and again.",0
"His father observed him, and said,",0
"Hansel, what are you gazing at there?",1
Why do you always remain behind?,1
"Take care, and don’t lose your footing.",1
"When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said,",0
"Now children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I’ll light a fire that you may not feel cold.",1
Hansel and Gretel heaped up brushwood until they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill.,0
"The brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said,",0
"Now lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves:",1
"We are going into the forest to cut down wood, and when we've finished we’ll come back and fetch you.",1
"Hansel and Gretel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread.",0
"They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near.",0
"But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind.",0
"When they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.",0
"When they awoke at last, it was pitch dark.",0
"Gretel began to cry, and said,",0
How are we ever to get out of the wood?,1
Hansel comforted her.,0
"Wait a bit,",1
"he said,",0
"until the moon is up, and then we’ll find our way sure enough.",1
"When the full moon had risen, he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new threepenny bits, and showed them the path.",0
"They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their father’s house again.",0
"They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed,",0
"You naughty children, what a time you've slept in the wood to!",1
We thought you were never going to come back.,1
"The father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.",0
"The children were awake again, and had heard the conversation.",0
"When the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again, as he had done the first time;",0
"but the woman had barred the door, and Hansel couldn't get out.",0
"But he consoled his little sister, and said,",0
"Don’t cry, Gretel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.",1
At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up.,0
"They received their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before.",0
"On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground.",0
"Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about you for?",1
Said the father.,0
"I’m looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,",1
answered Hansel.,0
Fool!,1
said the wife;,0
"that isn't your pigeon, it’s the morning sun glittering on the chimney.",1
But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path.,0
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before.,0
"Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said,",0
"Just sit down there children, and if you’re tired you can sleep a bit;",1
"we’re going into the forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we’re finished we’ll come back to fetch you.",1
"The children answered, ",0
"'Tis heaven’s own child, the tempest wild,",1
" and went on eating, without putting themselves about.",0
"Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Gretel pushed out a whole round window pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it.",0
"Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame, leaning on a staff, hobbled out.",0
Hansel and Gretel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall.,0
"The old woman shook her head and said,",0
"Oh, ho!",1
"You dear children, who led you here?",1
"Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you.",1
"She took them both by the hand, led them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them;",0
"milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts.",0
"After they had finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and when Hansel and Gretel lay down in them they felt as if they had gone to heaven.",0
"The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in.",0
When anyone came into her power;,0
"she killed, cooked and ate him, and held a regular feast day for the occasion.",0
"Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by.",0
"When Hansel and Gretel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly,",0
I’ve got them now;,1
they shan't escape me.,1
"Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself,",0
That’ll be a dainty bite.,1
"Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him.",0
"He might have screamed as much as he liked, for it would do him no good.",0
"Then she went to Gretel, shook her until she awoke, and cried,",0
"Get up, you lazy bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother.",1
When he’s fat I’ll eat him up.,1
"Gretel began to cry bitterly, but it was of no use;",0
she had to do what the wicked witch bade her.,0
"So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab shells.",0
"Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and cried,",0
"Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting fat.",1
"But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes were dim, couldn’t see it.",0
"Thinking always it was Hansel’s finger, she wondered why he fattened so slowly.",0
"When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer.",0
"Hi, Gretel,",1
"she called to the girl, ""Be quick and get some water.",0
"Hansel may be fat or thin, I’m going to kill him tomorrow and cook him."" Oh!",0
"How the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks!",0
Kind heaven help us now!,1
She cried.,0
"If only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together.",1
"Just hold your peace,",1
"said the old hag,",0
it won’t help you.,1
"Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire.",0
"First we’ll bake,",1
said the old dame.,0
I’ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough.,1
"She pushed Gretel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing.",0
"Creep in,",1
"said the witch,",0
"and see if it’s properly heated, so that we can shove in the bread.",1
"When she had got Gretel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too.",0
"But Gretel perceived her intention, and said,",0
I don’t know how I’m to do it;,1
how do I get in?,1
You silly goose!,1
Said the hag.,0
"The opening is big enough, see, I could get in myself,",1
"and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven.",0
"Then Gretel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt.",0
Gracious!,0
How she yelled;,0
"it was quite horrible, but Gretel fled and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.",0
"Gretel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable door and cried,",0
"Hansel, we are free;",1
the old witch is dead!,1
Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened.,0
"How they rejoiced, fell on each other’s necks, jumped for joy, and kissed one another!",0
"As they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hag’s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious stones.",0
"These are even better than pebbles,",1
"said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them.",0
"Gretel said,",0
"I too will bring something home,",1
and she filled her apron full.,0
"said Hansel,",0
let’s go and get well away from the witch’s wood.,1
When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake.,0
"We can’t get over,",1
"said Hansel,",0
I see no bridge of any sort or kind.,1
"Yes, and there’s no ferry boat either,",1
answered Gretel.,0
"But look, there swims a white duck.",1
"If I ask her she’ll help us over,",1
"and she called out,",0
"Here are two children, mournful very, seeing neither bridge nor ferry;",1
"take us upon your white back, and row us over, quack, quack!",1
"The duck swam towards them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him.",0
"answered Gretel,",0
we should be too heavy a load for the duck.,1
She shall carry us across separately.,1
"The good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw their father’s house in the distance.",0
"Then they set off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their father’s neck.",0
"The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, and the woman had died.",0
"Gretel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket.",0
"Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterwards.",0
"This is a story about luck, or chance or fate.",0
"Some people believe that everything that happens is set in the stars at the dawn of time and some people believe everything happens chaotically and at random, and other people believe that we are totally in charge of our own fate.",0
"And most of us, well we’re not quite sure what to believe.",0
Perhaps this story will help you make up your mind.,0
"Re-introducing Wicked Uncle Jeff (who is not so wicked at all) and the family of Mum, Dad, Jeremy and Jemima. Story by Bertie Read by Natasha. Duration twenty.forty.",0
Proofread by Jana Elizabeth,0
Oh dear.,1
"Sometimes it seems like the only things that ever happen in the world are wars, disasters, and celebrity divorces.",1
And the weather forecast isn’t much better.....,1
But one article caught her eye.,0
"She couldn’t miss it really, because there was a photograph of Dad’s brother, Jeff, whom the family liked to called The Wicked Uncle because he was totally irresponsible.",0
"He never had a proper job, or settled down with a family, and yet he owned several houses and even more cars, boats and motorcycles.",0
"In the picture, he was smartly dressed for the horse races known as Royal Ascot, and at his side was his latest girl-friend, tall, blonde and beautiful, and wearing a ludicrous pink hat.",0
The article said that he was sharing a box at the races with a Russian tycoon whom he had met by chance on a yacht.,0
Mum sighed.,0
Some people have all the luck.,1
Jeff seems to live a charmed life...,1
why can’t we share just a little bit of his good fortune?,1
I know.,1
I’ll see what my horoscope says...,1
it’s always fun to know in advance what sort of a day you’re going to have.,1
"Mum’s star sign was Libra, which was supposed to mean she was very fair and even-minded.",0
"In fact, Mum thought that her star sign gave a very accurate picture of her character.",0
The stars seemed to describe all her family.,0
"Dad was a Taurus, which meant that he was stubborn, and that was certainly true, And Jeremy was Leo the lion, which meant that he was cut out to be a great leader, and Jemima was Aquarius, the water sign, which explained why she was so good at swimming.",0
The truth was that really she believed in horoscopes.,0
"So as soon as she had finished reading today’s, she immediately wished that she hadn’t.",0
It said:,0
"The best thing you could do today, is to stay in bed.",1
All the stars and planets are opposed to you.,1
"Mars is waging war on you, Sagittarius the archer’s firing her arrows at you, Venus has deserted you, and Taurus the bull is charging you with its horns.",1
"Quite frankly, even staying in bed isn’t a fully safe option.",1
Better hide UNDER the bed and stay there until after the weekend.,1
Mum stood up crossly and tossed the newspaper in the pedal bin.,0
That’s ridiculous.,0
I can’t hide under the bed.,0
There isn’t room!...,0
 she exclaimed ,0
Oh my stars!,1
What a day this is shaping up to be.,1
But I’ll just have to struggle on and cook those nibbles even if all the forces of the Universe are working against me.,1
"And all day Mum was very careful not to cut herself with a kitchen knife, not to drop a weight on her foot, and not to leave the kitchen whilst anything was cooking in case a fire started.",0
"But even so, everything seemed ten times more difficult than usual.",0
"She ran out of caster sugar, she burnt her quiche, and she put too much mustard powder in the french dressing.",0
"And then, to top it all, she tripped over Rudy – he was the cat – and dropped her egg whites all over the floor.",0
Rudy started to lick up the goo.,0
"A black cat,",1
thought Mum.,0
"Get out of here you,",1
she screamed.,0
You’re nothing but Bad Luck!,1
"While Mum was bravely overcoming every obstacle that cruel fate threw in her way, Dad was also having one of those days.",0
He was stuck in the mother of all traffic jams.,0
"There had been an accident on the flyover, and the police were investigating.",0
"They were painstakingly picking up every fragment of glass, labelling it, and putting each one into its own separate plastic bag.",0
"And to make matters worse, Dad was desperate to go to the loo.",0
"As he sat at his wheel fuming and sweating, he called the office to give them an update.",0
A policeman tapped on his window.,0
"Excuse me sir, don’t you know there’s a law against using your mobile phone whilst driving?",1
"And by the way while we are about it, your front wheel is on the yellow grid.",1
You can’t stop here.,1
You’re blocking the traffic.,1
That will be two fines in one.,1
"And Dad had to get out of the car, show his driving licence, and answer all sorts of questions while four policemen examined his tyres and searched his boot for lethal weapons.",0
It was half-past one before Dad arrived at work.,0
"That makes sense,",1
he thought as he turned on his computer.,0
It’s Friday the thirteenth.,1
I should have called in sick.,1
"But Friday the thirteenth, which is supposed to be an unlucky day, had been just fine for Jeremy and Jemima at school.",0
"Jemima had a swimming lesson  – which she loved – and Jeremy was just glad because it was the end of the week, and on Saturday he would be playing football.",0
"When they got home though, they found that Mum was frantically searching for her car keys.",0
"I’m having a bit of a day,",1
"she said, sounding like she was having a nervous breakdown.",0
Jemima knew it would be best to stay out of Mum’s way.,0
Even Rudy was hiding in the coat cupboard.,0
But Jeremy asked:,0
Have you looked in the kitchen drawer?,1
Of course I have.,1
Do you think I’m stupid or what?,1
"snapped back Mum. But Jeremy opened the drawer, which was where they usually kept the keys, and lo and behold, that was where they were.",0
Mum mumbled thanks and grabbed some trays to take out and load into the car.,0
"Don’t just stand there, help me",1
she yelled at the kids.,0
And mind you don’t drop anything.,1
That would be all I need right now!,1
"Ten minutes later, Mum was gone, and Jeremy went up to his room to program his website while Jemima went to tell Rudy that it was safe to come out of the cupboard now.",0
"Then Jemima went upstairs to put the finishing touches to her school project all about Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. When Mum got home she kicked off her shoes, put her feet on the sofa and said:",0
What a day.,1
Thank goodness it’s over!,1
But it wasn’t.,0
"Ten minutes later the phone rang, and an angry voice asked where the food was for the party.",0
"But I just delivered it,",1
protested Mum.,0
"Not to here you didn’t,",1
exclaimed the voice.,0
"And after quite a bit of arguing, Mum realised that she must have delivered the food to the wrong office.",0
Some greedy office workers had accepted her snacks and were now celebrating the end of the week with a free feast!,0
While the real party was going on without any food.,0
"Mum had wasted her time and money, and at the end of it all, she had lost a customer.",0
"And if that wasn’t bad enough, Dad arrived home looking totally fed up.",0
"He had left the office early because he was feeling ill, but on the way back, smoke started rising from the bonnet of his car.",0
"The breakdown van towed it away to the garage, and he came home by bus.",0
"I don’t think I can keep on at this job,",1
he said.,0
"Ever since the office moved, I spend all my time getting there and back.",1
"And to top it all, Rudy the cat was sick;",0
"Not just sick but had diarrhoea - and not in any old place, like out in the garden or on the kitchen floor but in Jemima’s bedroom, and not just in Jemima’s bedroom, but all over her project on Queen Cleopatra. There was a terrible scream from the top of the house",0
"Oh my goodness, what’s happened?",1
exclaimed Mum. And then it was followed by a long heart-felt wail.....,0
My Project !!!!!!!!,1
Poor Jemima. She had worked so hard on her project.,0
And now she was going to have to spend the whole weekend doing it all again.,0
And she would have to miss her ballet class on Saturday and her swimming lesson on Sunday. But at least Jeremy was OK. Nothing had happened to him.,0
He was happily working on his computer until way too late.,0
"When Mum came to wish Jemima goodnight, she was sitting on her bed hugging a big bear that she had loved when she was little and looking very sad.",0
she asked.,0
Do you think our family’s cursed?,1
"I mean, we always seem to have bad luck.",1
"Don’t be silly,",1
said Mum.,0
We just had a bad day.,1
There’s no such thing as a curse or bad luck.,1
"Things just happen sometimes, that’s all.",1
But Mum didn’t sound at all convincing.,0
"You see, she did believe in bad luck.",0
"And in the morning, when Dad slipped on some sick the cat had made in the night, and landed in a heap on the kitchen floor, she couldn’t hide her true feelings any more.",0
"Listen kids,",1
"she said as she helped a badly shaken Dad up to his feet,",0
"I know this sounds a bit spooky, but we had all better be extra careful this weekend.",1
"My horoscope says that lots of bad things are going to happen, and judging by the last twenty-four hours, it’s coming all too true.",1
And that really scared Jemima.,0
"Mum, do you think like, anything really really bad could happen?",1
"Like, could we die?",1
And Jeremy thought that was absolutely hilarious.,0
He was still laughing about it as Dad drove him to the soccer fields.,0
He was the goal keeper and he knew that saving the ball required loads of skill and just a few drops of good luck.,0
Fortunately his luck seemed to be in.,0
"The other side had some great shots at goal, but Jeremy leapt, stretched and dived and kept the ball from crossing the line.",0
"The score was nil – nil until, ten minutes before the final whistle, his team’s defender tripped up the other side’s striker.",0
The referee blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty spot.,0
The centre forward was about to take the penalty.,0
He placed the ball on the spot and considered the goal.,0
Jeremy reckoned that he was eying up the top left corner of the posts.,0
His opponent ran up and struck the ball cleanly with his boot.,0
Jeremy sprang through the air like a ballet dancer and just reached the ball with his little finger.,0
"As he landed on the muddy ground he knew that he was the hero of the match, but oh, his little finger was hurting.",0
The ball had bent it back.,0
An hour later the phone rang at home.,0
"Jemima picked it up, before calling out:",0
"it’s the hospital, Jeremy’s in Accident and Emergency.",1
Mum prepared herself for the worst.,0
"She picked up the phone as bravely as she could and she had to ask the nurse to repeat what had happened three times before she understood that her son had probably broken his little finger, that his football trainer had to leave, and that somebody should come wait with Jeremy until he had an xray.",0
"Yes, I’ll come right away,",1
"said Mum. She went to the drawer to look for her keys, but they weren’t there.",0
Don’t you remember?,1
said Jemima.,0
"Dad’s car is broken-down, so he took yours to his golf match....",1
.but do you know what?,1
"Uncle Jeff lives not far from the hospital, maybe he could go and wait with Jeremy.",1
"Oh I expect he’s away on one of his exotic holidays,",1
said Mum.,0
"You know Uncle Jeff, he spends his weekends scuba diving or trekking in the Himalayas.",1
"But in fact Uncle Jeff was having a quiet weekend at home for once, and when Mum called, he said he would be only too pleased to help out, and besides, it would be an opportunity to catch up with his nephew and have a good chat while they waited.",0
"And by the time Uncle Jeff got to the hospital, Jeremy had already had his xray, and a splint was holding together two fingers on his left hand.",0
"Good job your trigger finger’s still in tact,",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
"Come on, let’s go clay pigeon shooting.",1
I reckon we’ve safely got two hours while your Mum thinks you’re still waiting at the hospital.,1
said Jeremy.,0
You bet!,1
"But back at home, Jemima and Mum had yet more anxiety.",0
Rudy was still sick and didn’t want to come out of the coat cupboard.,0
"They both wished that they had taken him to the vet that morning – but now it was Saturday afternoon, and they would have to wait until Monday.",0
This has to be the most unlucky weekend any family ever had,1
said Jemima. But Jeremy came back looking pleased with himself.,0
"After all, he was the hero of the match, and though he didn’t let on to Mum about it, he had a great time clay pigeon shooting.",0
When uncle Jeff heard about Rudy he said:,0
Don’t worry.,1
I know a woman who can do wonders for any cat.,1
She has healing hands.,1
"And although Mum didn’t have much faith in Uncle Jeff’s cat-healing friend, she was willing to give anything a try.",0
So Jeff took poor Rudy off in his basket and Jemima went with him.,0
They returned later with a very well and satisfied looking cat.,0
That’s a miracle.,1
What did she do?,1
asked Mum. And Jemima explained:,0
She said that he was suffering from stress and all he needed to do was to chill out.,1
"So she gave him a massage for an hour, and he was purring away in cat-heaven – and look – now he’s completely better.",1
"Well, well,",1
said Mum.,0
Jeff seems to have an easy answer to every problem.,1
Mum asked Uncle Jeff to stay for supper and he said that he would be delighted to eat some proper home cooking.,0
"She made her special cottage pie with steamed vegetables that she had grown in the garden and while they were eating, Jemima asked:",0
Uncle Jeff. Why are you so much luckier than we are?,1
"I mean, like, you’re Dad’s brother.",1
"But everything always seems to turn our right for you, and Dad, well, he just doesn’t seem to have any luck at all.",1
"Dad gave his daughter an annoyed stare, but he couldn’t protest as his mouth was full of cottage pie.",0
Jeff saw this and smiled affectionately at his brother.,0
"Well first of all, I don’t think I’m luckier than your Dad. Not one bit.",1
"He has a beautiful family, and I just have strings of girl-friends.",1
"In many ways, I’m quite envious of his steady life.",1
"And secondly, luck is just all about how you see things.",1
"Everything that’s happened to you this weekend could be seen as bad luck, but if you look at it differently, it could also be seen as good luck.",1
Good luck?,1
exclaimed Mum.,0
What’s been good about anything that’s happened yesterday or today?,1
"Well lots of things,",1
said Jeff.,0
"For instance, you delivered your party snacks to the wrong address.",1
"You lost a customer, but I’m willing to bet that the other office were very impressed by your delicious cooking.",1
And probably they are feeling just a bit guilty about eating your food for free.,1
So I see that as an opportunity.,1
"They are your next customer, and perhaps they will be a bigger and better customer.",1
And Dad’s having trouble getting to work since his office moved.,1
So why doesn’t he suggest to them that he works from home?,1
"Anyone can work from home these days, and it’s a much better lifestyle.",1
What?,1
Have him at home all day?,1
"I’m not so sure about that idea,",1
said Mum. But Jeff went on.,0
"And as for Jemima. Yes, her project was ruined, but that gave her a chance to do it again, and do it even better.",0
"And even Rudy being sick was good luck for him, because he scored an enjoyable cat massage.",0
"As for Jeremy, yes he broke his finger, but he saved the match, and breaking his finger to do it made him even more of a hero in the eyes of his mates.",0
And finally all this has been a wonderful opportunity for a family get-together – which is something we don’t do often enough.,0
"So actually Jemima,",1
"said Uncle Jeff,",0
I don’t especially have any good luck.,1
"In fact, I’m always getting into all sorts of trouble and scrapes.",1
"You lead a much more steady life, and in some ways, I’m quite envious of you.",1
"But I believe that the whole trick is not to see our little problems as bad luck, but to see them as opportunities.",1
"And although Mum didn’t entirely see things the way Uncle Jeff did, she now understood the secret of how he seemed to be always followed around by good luck.",0
"Beatrice has called off the wedding, left the palace, and gone to live in the town and look for a job.",0
"How will the ex-princess get on in the ""real world""?",0
Beatrice’s new home was a room in the loft of a tall house.,0
She gazed out of the window at the terrace of houses across the street.,0
"Each house was a carbon copy of all the others, except for the colour of the door.",0
"There were red, green and blue doors.",0
"To some people this might look like a drab, ordinary street,",1
"she thought,",0
but to me it is a dream come true.,1
A family lived in the house.,0
"The mother was called Angelina, and she said that Maureen - because that was what Beatrice had pretended her name was - could live in the loft room if she got the kids up in the morning and took them to school.",0
"Beatrice, or should I say Maureen, was more than happy with this offer.",0
"The kids, Charlie and Ellie, were perfectly nice, though as with all kids, it was a bit of an ordeal getting them to put on their shoes and coats.",0
"After she had dropped them off at school, Beatrice went to look for a job.",0
She walked down the High Street until she came to a coffee shop with a notice in the window that read;,0
New coffee maistro wanted.,1
She summoned up all her courage and went inside to ask if she could speak to the manager about a job.,0
Have you ever worked in a coffee shop before?,1
asked Jenny who ran the shop.,0
"said Beatrice,",0
 but I’m very artistic and I know how to paint smiley faces and leaf shapes in the froth on top of the coffee.,1
"Well that’s a good start,",1
"said Jenny,",0
We’ll give you a try for a day.,1
Beatrice was put in charge of making the coffee.,0
"She painted beautiful faces on all the coffees she made, but she spent so long perfecting each one, that the customers complained:",0
"Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa faster than this,",1
said one.,0
Jenny decided that Beatrice was not right for the job because she was too slow.,0
"The next day, Beatrice signed up with an office agency.",0
They sent her to work as a receptionist in a big shiny building.,0
"Her job was to check visitors in, give them security badges, and send them up in the lift to the right floor for their meetings.",0
"At first she was very good at this, because she was naturally helpful and all the visitors liked her.",0
But then a smartly dressed man and woman rushed in all flustered and panicky and saying they were late for their meeting.,0
"Their names were not on Beatrice’s list, but she gave them badges without delay so as not to make them any later.",0
It turned out that they were thieves who stole four mobile phones and two laptops from a conference room upstairs.,0
Beatrice was fired for letting them into the building.,0
Her next job was as a parking warden.,0
"She looked super-smart in her uniform, but as you might guess, she was too soft hearted to give people fines for parking in the wrong place.",0
"Every driver had a hard luck sob story, and she let them off.",0
"Even when the driver wasn’t there to plead their cause, she felt sorry for them, and imagined that they must have only parked on a double yellow line because they absolutely had to.",0
She was fired for not giving out enough fines.,0
"That evening, Beatrice sat in her attic room and cried a little.",0
"I’m really not good at anything,",1
she thought.,0
"She wondered if Bertie was missing her, and for the first time since she left the palace, she put her old sim card in her phone.",0
"As soon as the phone switched on, it went,",0
"ping, ping, ping ping!",1
Because Bertie had been sending her loads and loads of messages like:,0
"Beatrice I dream about you all the time, when I’m asleep and awake.",0
"and Life isn’t fair, but the world’s a kinder place when you are a princess and I promise to try harder to understand you better and help you fulfill your dreams.",0
There were more messages like this.,0
Beatrice thought:,0
"Ah Bertie, he’s such a sweetie pie.",0
" She pressed Reply on one of the messages, and was about to ask him to send a limo to pick her up and take her back home to the palace, when a lightning bolt of defiance ran through her:",1
‘I can’t go back.,1
Not until I’ve succeeded at something on my own two feet without help or favour from anyone.,1
"For the next two days, she looked for jobs, but all them needed good exam results or lots of experience, and Beatrice had neither.",0
Then at last an advertisement caught her eye.,0
It said.,0
She read on.,0
Are you gutsy enough to face our crowd and tell them jokes?,1
"Make our audience laugh, and we’ll pay you five hundred pounds.",1
"But if you don’t succeed, you get nothing.",1
"Can’t say fairer than that,",1
thought Beatrice. Now you may know that Prince Bertie fancies himself as a comedian.,0
"Opinion is very divided as to whether he’s actually funny or not, in fact, it would seem that quite a lot of people think not.",0
Beatrice said to herself:,0
"I bet I would be better at making people laugh than Bertie,",1
"and she filled in the entry form on the website calling herself, Maureen the ex princess.",0
Thursday night came.,0
"Beatrice had been practicing her comedy act in front of the mirror, and she thought she was pretty funny.",0
As she took the bus to the Ha Ha Club she was confident that she would win the five hundred pounds.,0
"But when she walked into the club, and saw the stage, she suddenly felt frightened.",0
How embarrassing it would be to tell jokes that nobody thought was funny!,0
"It’s all very well if you are Bertie, who has got a skin as thick as a castle moat, but she was a sensitive type.",0
aNow she felt more terrified than the time she met a ghost in the North Wing of the palace.,0
"She wanted to run to her mummy, but then she remembered that her stepmother was the Queen frog, and there was no point in running to her because she would just laugh wickedly and call her a good for nothing goody two shoes.",0
So she took a deep breath and reported to the manager.,0
"Good thing you are early,",1
"he said,",0
Because we’ve got you on first tonight.,1
"There’s no turning back,",1
"she thought,",0
I can only do my best.,1
And that’s what she did.,0
An hour later she stood behind the microphone and blinked.,0
In dark corners of the room people were chatting and not paying any notice of her.,0
"Others in the front were gazing up at her intently, and that was even more frightening.",0
"Er hello,",1
"she said,",0
"I used to be a Princess, but now I’m just Maureen.",1
One person chuckled:,0
she felt so grateful to this unknown supporter that she wanted to kiss him.,0
She glanced up and ...,0
"oh no, oh my, it couldn’t be, but oh it could be, in fact it was:",0
it was Prince Bertie. This was terrible.,0
How dare he turn up like this and ruin her performance?,0
He had put her in an impossible position.,0
"If she wasn’t funny, she had failed, and if she made people laugh, Bertie would hate her for being funnier than him.",0
"Well she would show him, she would be hilarious and she did not care how jealous he was of her talent.",0
She launched into her first joke:,0
"There was this girl in my class who said to her daddy,",0
I feel embarrassed.,0
"The other kids come to school on the bus and they see me being dropped off by the chauffeur in the Rolls Royce. He replied, ",0
"That’s no problem dear, I’ll buy you a bus.’ The audience thought this was pretty funny and Bertie was laughing more than anyone.",0
Beatrice began to enjoy herself.,0
She told everyone about funny things that had happened in her jobs:,0
"‘I was about to give a parking ticket to a car when the driver turned up, clutched his chest and rolled on the ground pretending to have a heart attack.",0
Well even the meanest parking warden can’t give a fine to a sick man.,0
I tore up the ticket and was about to call an ambulance when he jumped up and got into the driving seat:,0
"‘Hey I thought you were dying,’ I said.",0
"‘I just got better,’ he replied , ‘I’m fine, you’re fine, and best of all, there’s no parking fine!’ And when I worked in a coffee shop, there was a smartly dressed woman who came rushing in and called out:’",0
"Quick, quick I need coffee right this second:",1
I’m late for work.,1
"I rushed an emergency coffee to her, she calmly took it, and sat down.",0
At almost lunch time she was still sunk in the sofa staring into the froth of her coffee.,0
"I said,",0
Didn’t you say you were late for work?,0
"’ She glanced at the time and said, ‘Yes, I was late then and I’m even later now.’ ‘Doesn’t your employer mind?’ I asked.",0
"‘No,’ she said, ‘I’m never late more than once a day.’ ‘Good for you.",0
What do they say when you turn up?’ I asked.,0
"She smiled and told me, ‘Well they usually say something like, ",0
Hello Boss.,1
’ Which explained everything.,0
"So now I know a bit more about life in the real world, and to be honest, it does not see, any less unfair than being a princess.",0
"Owing to a bit of disorganisation, Bertie slept through Halloween this year, despite all ghostly moans and growns, and the fireworks going off everywhere.",0
And so this year’s spooky story comes about a month late.,0
"I told him not to worry, because people always appreciate a chilly scare, whatever the time of year.",0
The date of her birth caused an annual diary clash for the family.,0
"Dad liked to take mum out to a restaurant for her birthday, but the kids were excited about Halloween and wanted to dress up and go trick or treating.",0
"This year, Uncle Jeff and his girlfriend Jessica came to the rescue and offered to take the kids away for Halloween weekend.",0
"Jeff said the best place to celebrate the spookiest time of year was in the countryside, because far away from the city lights, you can see the moon and the stars, and you feel much closer to the ancient spirit of the universe.",0
"Jessica said that Jeff was talking nonsense, but she always enjoyed long walks in the fresh air with her little dog, Smoochies. It was a long drive.",0
"Both the kids were playing with their tablets, but Jeremy had forgotten to charge his overnight, and it did not last beyond Junction six on the motorway.",0
"Let me help you with that game,",1
"he said to Jemima, and he grabbed her tablet.",0
A tug of war started on the back seat.,0
"Hey you two, behave!",1
said Jessica turning round from the passenger seat.,0
"And then, hoping to distract the siblings from fighting, she added:",0
Let’s see who can tell the spookiest story.,1
You first Jeremy..,1
see if you can make me really frightened through the power of words.,1
"Well let me see,",1
said Jeremy.,0
We have a teacher at school who is a vampire and everyone is frightened of him because he comes up behind your chair in geography and sucks your blood.,1
"Ooh, that’s scary,",1
exclaimed Jessica.,0
"He’s not really a vampire,",1
said Jemima.,0
He just has pointy teeth.,1
"Exactly, like vampires do.",1
said Jeremy.,0
Let’s see if you can come up with a scary story..,1
or not.,1
"Ooh I’m so frightened already, and you haven’t even said a word.",1
"Well my friend’s house is haunted,",1
said Jemima.,0
She lives near the town castle that used to be a prison.,1
"There’s a secret tunnel that goes all the way from one of the cells into the cellar of her house, and the ghosts of the prisoners come along it and make spooky noises in her bedroom.",1
"The sounds are just the wind in the oak tree,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"Well I think that story is scary,",1
said Jessica.,0
Mine’s more of a riddle.,1
Why couldn’t Dracula get to sleep?,1
Because he was busy biting people?,1
suggested Jeremy.,0
"Well maybe that too, but the answer is because of his coffin.",1
"Like coughing - coffin, get it?",1
But the children were not amused.,0
It was Uncle Jeff’s turn.,0
He spoke as he sped steadily down the fast lane at ninety miles per hour.,0
I heard this true story when I was in Australia earlier in the year.,0
A couple were going across the outback when the satnav told them to turn off the road down a rough track.,0
"They thought it was a bit strange, but they obeyed the instructions.",0
"They drove on and on, and just as it was getting dark they reached an old deserted house.",0
The satnav said:,0
"You have reached your destination,",1
and then it gave a wicked sort of laugh before adding:,0
Enjoy your stay in the haunted homestead.’ ,0
"When they tried to turn the car around, it wouldn’t move.",1
They were way too frightened to go into the house and so they spent the night in the car.,1
"All sorts of ghosts and ghouls floated up to peer at them through the windows, and they heard dreadful moans and screams coming from the house.",1
"In the morning, the car started just as normal, and they sped back the way they had come and found their way to the farm where their friends lived.",1
Their friends told them about the ghost that haunts satnavs and regularly leads people to the homestead where one hundred years ago a dreadful murder took place.,1
The company that makes the satnav is completely baffled by this and the only explanation is that it is supernatural.,1
"Oh that’s creepy,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"Yes, Jeff wins the prize for the spookiest story,",1
agreed Jessica.,0
Can satnavs really be haunted?,1
asked Jemima.,0
"Naaa,",1
said Jeff.,0
There’s no such thing as the supernatural.,1
"People are afraid of getting lost in the dark, and their imaginations play all sorts of tricks.",1
"And so they continued their journey to Somerset. A long jam on the motorway past Bristol held them up, and it was already dark by the time they were anywhere near their destination.",0
Jeff turned on his satnav because he didn’t know this part of the world.,0
He programmed in the name of a village.,0
It was called Huish Cottonbois. Soon they were travelling down country lanes with high hedges on either side.,0
"In fifty meters, at the junction, go straight head,",1
said the sat navf.,0
"Thanks Emily,",1
replied Jeff.,0
Who’s Emily?,1
asked Jeremy.,0
"He calls the satnav Emily after his first girlfriend,",1
said Jessica.,0
I trust I won’t end up inside a piece of electrical equipment one day.,1
"After they crossed the junction, they started to climb a hill.",0
"Before too long, first mist, and then fog, cloaked the road ahead.",0
Jeff slowed down the car.,0
It was hard to see much further than the end of the bonnet.,0
"I’m scared,",1
said Jemima.,0
"Don’t worry, Jeff’s a very good driver,",1
said Jessica.,0
"I know,",1
"said Jemima,",0
but this place is spooky.,1
Let’s go home.,1
Jeff laughed:,0
Home now?,1
We’re about fifteen minutes away from our stay.,1
But that proved to be one of Jeff’s less accurate predictions.,0
"Emily told him to turn right, and as always he did exactly what Emily told him to do.",0
"Then she told him to turn left, and he turned left.",0
"This was a much narrower lane than before, and the tall trees on either side made it into a sort of tunnel.",0
It was like they were travelling through darkness and time.,0
Eventually they passed a few houses and came to the end of the road.,0
Emily said:,0
Bear right.,1
"But that’s not a road, it’s just a track,",1
said Jessica. And it was.,0
"Well Emily’s not giving me much choice,",1
said Jeff.,0
"And besides, I don’t think I could find the way back.",1
Better do as the old girl says.,1
She’s never let me down yet.,1
And he pressed his foot on the accelerator.,0
The gravel crunched and the car bumped.,0
They went further into the woods and it grew darker and darker.,0
"Smoochies, who was sitting on Jessica’s lap, started to howl.",0
Arroooooooooh!,1
From the back seat the kids were pleading:,0
"Please Uncle Jeff, let’s go back.",1
That’s not Emily’s voice in the satnav.,1
"It’s a ghost, and it’s leading us into a haunted wood.",1
And Jessica said:,0
"I don’t think this can be right Jeff. Even Smoochies seems to think this is the wrong way, and you know, dogs have an amazing sense of direction..",1
"Although Smoochies is indeed a clever animal,",1
"said Jeff,",0
"when it comes to directions, I’ll take Emily’s word for it.",1
That’s blown it.,1
"I’ll have to call for roadside assistance,",1
said Jeff.,0
Roadside!,1
We’re not even on a road!,1
We’re in the middle of a forest!,1
exclaimed his normally calm girlfriend.,0
A haunted forest!,1
clarified Jeremy.,0
I don’t suppose the breakdown driver will dare to come down here.,1
It’s way too spooky.,1
Jeff looked at his phone.,0
There was no signal.,0
"Ok, I’ll go back to those houses and ring for help from there.",1
You’re not leaving us are you?,1
asked Jemima.,0
"Well you can come with me if you prefer,",1
said Jeff. But only Smoochies was keen to go with him.,0
Jessica tried to keep up the kids’ spirits with terrible jokes.,0
"She had written several of them down in her notebook before they left, because she wanted to be well prepared for a weekend with children.",0
"Unfortunately, all the anecdotes were to do with Halloween, and therefore inappropriately spooky.",0
"Ha Ha,",1
"said Jeremy, in a flat, deadpan sort of way.",0
But Jemima’s voice was far more animated:,0
Oh Oh I heard a ghost!,1
she exclaimed.,0
"It was just an owl,",1
Jessica reassured her.,0
It took Jeff and Smoochies twenty minutes to trudge back to the houses they had passed on the way.,0
"At the first gate, they were greeted by such ferocious growling and barking that they thought it wiser to back off.",0
"At the next house, the guard dog, though in full voice, was confined safely indoors.",0
"Eventually the door was opened just a crack by a farmer, who looked suspiciously out through the chained gap.",0
"Sorry to bother you,",1
said Jeff.,0
Our car’s stuck in a ditch down the track.,1
"I expect you were following the satnav,",1
replied the farmer.,0
It sends all sorts down there.,1
Trucks and cars.,1
Too often we have to tow them out.,1
"If I could use your phone, I could call for assistance?",1
asked Jeff.,0
"They won’t go down the track,",1
said the farmer.,0
I’d better get the tractor.,1
"Back in the car, the children were hugging each other - not a common sight.",0
"It was partly to keep warm, but mostly because they were afraid.",0
What’s that sound?,1
asked Jemima with a shudder.,0
It was a low rumble.,0
"I think,",1
"said Jeremy,",0
that it’s a beast of some sort.,0
The beast crunched and growled over the gravel.,0
"Whatever it is, it’s getting closer,",1
"said Jessica, who was ashamed to admit to herself that she was feeling scared.",0
She was a doctor.,0
Doctors are meant to be scientific and rational.,0
They aren’t supposed to believe in the supernatural.,0
But this was the night before Halloween and they were deep in a dark forest.,0
All they could hear was the sound of a giant beast.,0
How could even a doctor not feel afraid?,0
At least Jessica managed to keep her eyes open.,0
She stared into the darkness.,0
Soon she saw that the beast had two shining eyes just like - well - headlamps.,0
"Hey kids, it’s not a monster, it’s another car.",1
In fact it was the tractor.,0
Jeff jumped down and said:,0
Ghost Busters at your service.,1
A good tug on the towing rope was all it took to extricate Jeff’s expensive city car out of the Somerset ditch.,0
"The farmer advised Jeff not to trust satnavs around these parts, and drew a map in Jessica’s notebook.",0
Soon they were on their way to Huish Cottonbois. Before they reached the village they spotted a sign to a farm where the owner had converted two of his barns into holiday lets.,0
Jeff had booked one of them over the internet.,0
"They turned down another gravel track, but this time they were a little more confident that they were heading the right way.",0
It led them down a steep hill through pitch black darkness.,0
"I wouldn’t like to walk down here,",1
said Jessica.,0
Why ever not?,1
asked Jeff. You’re in the countryside.,0
It’s a hundred times safer than the city.,0
But it’s spooooky!,1
said the kids.,0
Eventually they reached the lights of the farmhouse.,0
Farm dogs barked and Smoochies replied with shrill woofs.,0
"Their host, Jillie, came out of the main building and showed the new arrivals into their barn.",0
"The photographs on the internet had shown a cosy place, but this was basic.",0
"The beds were bunks, the mattresses were lumpy and dippy, and whoever had plastered the walls had left big gaps.",0
The temperature was on the cool side.,0
"There’s not even a lock on the door,",1
complained Jessica.,0
That’s because nothing ever happens around here.,1
"It never has, and it never will,",1
Jeff reassured her.,0
"Besides,",1
"said Jeremy,",0
ghosts can walk through walls so there’s no point in locking the door.,1
"They slept well after their long journey, and the following day on Halloween, they visited a lake, a castle, and the sea.",0
"The countryside was stunning, perhaps because it hadn’t changed for hundreds, maybe thousands of years, and you could feel that Jeff was right.",0
"Here nothing ever happens, nothing ever changes, life just follows its natural rhythm and the cycle of the seasons.",1
"In the evening, the kids carved pumpkins, exchanged trick or treats with the family in the next door barn, and dressed up in masks and costumes.",0
Jessica painted their faces ghostly white with little dashes of rouge for blood.,0
Smoochies wore bat wings and a hat with red pointy ears.,0
"Overall, they looked like a convincing family of ghouls.",0
Their aim for the night was to visit the local bonfire and fireworks display on the village green.,0
"In times past, fireworks were held on November the fiveth, to celebrate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot to blow up King James the onest at the State opening of the The Houses of Parliament in one thousand, six hundred and five.",0
"For centuries children made effigies of Guy Fawkes, wheeled him around houses asking:",0
"A penny for the guy,",1
and then burnt the stuffed clothes on the bonfire.,0
This was how Jeff and his brother had celebrated in the dark nights of their childhoods.,0
"But nowadays in our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island, we have imported American ways, and our winter fun is held on Halloween. That night there was no fog.",0
It was relatively warm and lit by a full moon.,0
Jessica headed for the car but Jeff said:,0
The village is just down the lane.,1
Let’s walk.,1
What?,1
Through the spooky dark?,1
asked Jeremy.,0
"Exactly,",1
said Jeff.,0
"The best reason for Halloween is to confront our irrational fears, and you’ll see, they’ll just melt away into the night.",1
"But my feet hurt,",1
complained Jeremy.,0
Come on.,1
No excuses.,1
"Any ghouls will be scared away by that costume of yours,",1
said Jeff firmly.,0
"He shone his torch up the track, and that was the way they went.",0
Jessica held Jemima’s hand.,0
"Jeremy trudged five paces behind the others, so that he could be in front if they had to turn and run from a spectre.",0
They reached the lane where the main concern was to stay safe from cars.,0
Jeff saw headlights ahead and made them stand on the grassy verge.,0
The car went safely past and they marched on towards the village.,0
Five minutes later they saw another flicker of lights.,0
"To the side,",1
commanded Jeff. But Jessica replied:,0
That isn’t a car.,0
It’s a firework.,0
A couple of bangs and some red and green stardust confirmed that she was right.,0
"Wizz, fizz, capow!",1
went the next rocket.,0
Everyone knew that there was no point in protesting.,0
Uncle Jeff sprung over a gate and the others clambered after him.,0
The field was muddy and squelchy.,0
Are you sure this is a good idea?,1
"asked Jessica. They were heading into pitch blackness, only occasionally illuminated by the festive explosions overhead.",0
"Oooh, what’s that?",1
asked Jeremy pointing towards a giant shape that was distinctly moving.,0
"Just a cow,",1
replied Jeff.,0
Can’t cows trample you to death?,1
asked Jessica.,0
said Jeff.,0
Do cows normally snort like that?,0
asked Jemima. The cow sounded like it had terrible sinus problems.,0
Smoochies started barking like crazy.,0
Boom boom.,1
The ground shook.,0
"Those weren’t fireworks,",1
said Jessica.,0
That cow of yours is stomping on the ground like...,1
like...,1
A bull...!,1
cried Jeff.,0
And they ran for their lives.,0
"Whether it was actually a cow or a bull, they didn’t find out, because fortunately they all made it back to the gate in one piece.",0
Did you see its eyes?,1
asked Jeremy.,0
They were glowing red.,1
It wasn’t just a bull.,1
It was a demon bull.,1
"Those were fireworks,",1
said Jeff. But the the kids and Jessica were convinced that its eyes really did glow in the dark.,0
"They watched the end of the fireworks from the safety of the road, before making their way back to barn where they warmed up with bowls of pumpkin soup.",0
"Well kids,",1
"said Jeff,",0
don’t you agree that it’s a good thing to confront your irrational fears?,1
Irrational?,1
spluttered Jessica.,0
What’s irrational about being afraid of a deadly bull in a dark field?,1
"It wasn’t a bull, it was a cow,",1
insisted Jeff.,0
"It was you who told us to run for our lives,",1
replied Jessica.,0
"When you’ve got kids, you have to err on the side of caution,",1
Jeff explained.,0
Caution?,1
"You wouldn’t know what caution was if it headbutted you up a tree,",1
replied his girlfriend.,0
There was a minute or two of sullen silence before Jeff thought of a way to change the subject:,0
Well who wants sparklers?,1
he asked.,0
MEEEE!,1
cried both the kids.,0
And they went outside to write their names in the night with sprinkling lights on sticks.,0
"After a long drive, slowed by fog on the motorway, they arrived home late on Sunday evening.",0
Did you have a super spooky Halloween in the countryside?,1
asked Mum.,0
"It was spooky,",1
replied Jemima.,0
"A bit too spooky,",1
"added Jeremy. When Jessica and Jeff were alone in the car, Jessica said:",0
"Next year, let’s celebrate Halloween in the city, and confront our fears with silly costumes, loads of chockies and sweets.",1
"No more lonely lanes, dark woods, haunted satnavs, or demon bulls.",1
"I suppose you’re right,",1
"said Jeff. He started the car, resigned to the fact that his family and his girlfriend were city souls through and through.",0
Download the Audio MPthree of Puss in Boots Once upon a time there was a poor miller who had three sons.,0
"The years went by and the miller died, leaving nothing but his mill, his donkey, and a cat.",0
"The eldest son took the mill, the second-born son rode off on the donkey, and the youngest son inherited the cat.",0
"Oh, well,",1
"said the youngest son,",0
"I’ll eat this cat, and make some mittens out of his fur.",1
Then I will have nothing left in the world and shall die of hunger.,1
"The cat was listening to his master complain like this, but he pretended not to have heard anything.",0
"Instead, he put on a serious face and said:",0
"Do not look so sad, master.",1
"Just give me a bag and a pair of boots, and I will show you that you did not receive such a poor inheritance in me.",1
"The cat’s master had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the grain, and pretend to be dead.",0
"Thinking this over, he thought that it wasn’t impossible that the cat could help him after all, so he gave the cat his bag and spent his last pennies on ordering a fine pair of boots to be made especially for the cat.",0
"The cat looked very gallant in his boots, and putting his bag around his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws and lay by a rabbit warren, which was home to a great many rabbits.",0
"He put bran and corn into his bag, and stretching as if he were dead, waited for some young rabbits, still not acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage in his bag for the bran and corn.",0
"Tell thy master,",1
"said the king,",0
that I thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.,1
"Another time he went and hid himself among a cornfield, holding still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew the strings and so caught them both.",0
"He went and made a present of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit.",0
"The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.",0
"In this way, the cat continued for two or three months to bring presents to the king, always saying that they were from his master, the Marquis of Carabas. One day in particular, he heard at the palace that the king was planning to drive in his carriage along the river bank, taking with him his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world.",0
Puss in Boots said to his master:,0
"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made.",1
"You have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in the place that I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.",1
"The miller’s son did what the cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.",0
"While he was washing, the king passed by, and the cat began to cry out:",0
Help!,1
Help!,1
"My Lord, Marquis of Carabas, is going to be drowned!",1
This cunning cat had hidden the clothes under a great stone.,0
"The king immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas. The king was very pleased to meet the Marquis of Carabas, and the fine clothes he had given him suited him extremely well, for although poor, he was a handsome and a well built fellow.",0
"The king’s daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction.",0
"The king invited him to sit in the coach and ride along with them, with the lifeguards in glittering uniform trotting along side.",0
"The cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:",0
"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the king that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, those soldiers will chop you up like herbs for the pot.",1
The king did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.,0
"To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,",1
"answered they altogether, for the cat’s threats had made them terribly afraid.",0
"You see, sir,",1
"said the Marquis,",0
this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.,1
"The master cat, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:",0
"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the king that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped up like herbs for the pot.",1
"The king, who passed by a moment after, wished to know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong.",0
"To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,",1
"replied the reapers, and the king was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated.",0
Then the king said:,0
Let us now go to your castle.,1
"The miller’s son, not knowing what to reply, looked at puss who said:",0
"If Your Majesty will but wait an hour, I will go on before and order the castle to be made ready for you.",1
"With that, she jumped away and went to the castle of a great ogre and asked to see him, saying he could not pass so near his home without having the honour of paying his respects to him.",0
"The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit down.",0
"I have been assured,",1
"said the cat,",0
that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures as you wish;,1
"you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.",1
"That is true,",1
"answered the ogre very briskly,",0
"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.",1
"Puss was so terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately climbed up the curtains, not without difficulty, because his boots were no use to him for climbing.",0
"A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down and admitted he had been very much frightened.",0
"However,",1
"said the cat,",0
"I fear that you will not be able to save yourself even in the form of a lion, for the king is coming with his army and means to destroy you.",1
"The ogre looked out of the window and saw the king waiting outside with his soldiers, and said:",0
What shall I do?,1
How shall I save myself?,1
Puss replied:,0
"If you can also change yourself into something very small, then you can hide.",1
"In an instant, the ogre turned himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.",0
Puss no sooner saw this but he fell upon him and ate him up.,0
"Puss, who heard the noise of His Majesty’s coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the king:",0
Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.,1
What!,1
"My Lord Marquis,",1
cried the king.,0
Does this castle also belong to you?,1
There can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it.,1
"Let us go into it, if you please.",1
"The Marquis gave his hand to the princess, and followed the king, who went first.",0
"They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent rum punch, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him.",0
"The friends, however, dared not to enter, knowing that the king was there.",0
"His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with him, and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses:",0
"If you do not, my Lord Marquis, become my son in law, it will be of your own choosing.",1
"The Marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honour which His Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the princess.",0
"Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice anymore, except for pleasure.",0
Version by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration eighteen.twenty-seven.,0
"Proofread by Claire Deakin & Jana Elizabeth. Samson and Delilah - A long time ago, in a land where the sun was searingly hot, a man was making his way through a vineyard.",0
The vines brushed against his broad thighs as he went.,0
"He was young and handsome, and long hair fell down his muscular back.",0
"He had taken an oath never to cut his hair, drink wine, or to touch a dead person.",0
"For this oath, he was considered to be a Holy Man. Whether his character was holy, that is something I will leave for you to judge.",0
Now crouching among the vines was a lion.,0
He swished his tail like a cat about to pounce upon a mouse.,0
His nostrils quivered at the scent of man.,0
His ears tuned into the sound of footsteps and rustling vine leaves.,0
Then he sprang with his jaws open and his claws extended.,0
"Samson, for that was the name of his intended victim, punched the lion on the chin, and then tore him apart with his bare hands.",0
Soon the creature lay dead among the vines.,0
"Samson was pleased with this encounter, because he liked a good scrap.",0
"But there was something he liked even more, and that was a pretty face.",0
"It must have been his lucky day, because at the bottom of the hill he spied a lovely young woman sitting on the steps of her father’s house.",0
"The girl was a Philistine, and Samson was an Israelite. Their people were enemies.",0
"In fact, at this time, the Philistines ruled over the Israelites, but Samson did not care about politics.",0
"Make love, not war,",1
he said to himself.,0
"He sat down next to the Philistine girl and spoke to her, and she liked this handsome young stranger as much as he liked her.",0
"On his way back home, Samson passed back through the vineyard where he had met the lion.",0
"He heard a buzzing sound, and saw that bees were swarming around the dead beast.",0
The corpse was now filled with a thick amber coloured liquid.,0
Samson scooped some of the sticky stuff up onto his fingers and tasted it.,0
It was honey.,0
He dug out more of the sweetness with his hand and ate it.,0
"As the honey melted on his tongue, he felt his muscles grow even stronger.",0
By the time he reached home he felt so full of energy and power that he was certain he could fight a whole army single-handed and win.,0
He did not tell his parents about the lion or the honey.,0
He decided to keep that secret for himself.,0
"Instead he described the girl to his mother, and told her that he intended to marry her.",0
"His mother threw up her arms and said,",0
Is there not a single woman among your own people that you might marry?,1
But his father said that it was the Lord’s will that their son should wed the daughter of a Philistine.,0
"Let them take Samson into their family,",1
he said.,0
They deserve him.,1
His wife knew exactly what he meant.,0
The wedding feast lasted seven days on end.,0
"Long tables were set outside in the girl’s village, and the trestles were laden with piles of goat’s meat, figs, grapes, stuffed vine leaves, hummus, fried aubergines and other delicacies.",0
Philistines and Israelites sat side by side around the tables.,0
They ate and drank together.,0
"They sang and danced together, and they laid bets and dares for each other.",0
"In fact after not very long, anyone coming upon this wedding celebration would have a hard time saying who was Philistine and who was Israelite. On the very first night, Samson gave the guests a riddle to solve.",0
"He promised that if anyone could find its meaning, he would give each and every one of his guests a fine set of clothes – But if none of the guests could guess the riddle by the end of the feast, then they must give him thirty sets of new clothes.",0
This was the riddle:,0
"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.",1
What was strong and what was sweet?,1
"The bride’s father glanced at his daughter to see from her face if she knew the answer, but she looked as puzzled by Samson’s words as everyone else did.",0
"After three days of feasting, none of the guests had divined Samson’s meaning.",0
"On the forth day, the girl’s father sat down next to her and whispered into her ear:",0
Can’t you entice your husband to give you the answer to his riddle?,1
"Later that night with tears in her eyes, she stroked Samson’s face and told him,",0
"You say you love me, but you are keeping secrets from me.",1
I will not trust in your love until you tell me the answer to your riddle.,1
She wept every day until at last Samson surrendered the answer to her.,0
"On the seventh day, at the end of the feast, one of the guests stood up and announced,",0
"Samson, I have solved your riddle.",1
For what is sweeter than honey or stronger than a lion?,1
"When Samson heard this, he shook his fist with rage and said:",0
"If you had not schemed with my wife, you would not have found out my riddle.",1
Which meant that he knew that somehow they had got the truth out of his wife.,0
"He had no trouble finding clothes to give to his guests He went down to the city of Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their clothes.",0
"When he had done this, he went to the house of his wife’s family to take away his wife with him.",0
There he discovered that her father had already given her away to another man – a friend of Samson’s.,0
"I thought you had deserted us,",1
he said simply.,0
"But here, take her sister, she’s no less pretty.",1
Samson looked at the sister.,0
"It was true, she was no less pretty than his wife, but the suggestion was an insult to him, his wife, and her sister.",0
"He left the farmhouse promising his revenge, which followed soon after.",0
He caught numerous foxes and then he tied burning torches to their tales.,0
The poor terrified animals ran through the fields and set alight the corn and the nearby farms.,0
"The whole sky was lit up with the blaze, and for miles around the Philistines had lost their crops.",0
The cycle of violence continued.,0
The Philistines took revenge on the Israelites for Samson’s deeds.,0
"Samson slew the Philistines, either with his bare hands, or with nothing more than the jaw bone of a donkey for a weapon.",0
"He was so filled with loathing, strength and fury that an entire Philistine army could not defeat him.",0
He also had a taste for sweetness as well as for war.,0
"Sometime later, he fell in love with a woman from the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. She was more beautiful and clever than any of the women he had come across before.",0
She had wiles and guile and she understood exactly how to win him over to her point of view.,0
"There was almost nothing he would refuse her, if it was in his power.",0
"What Samson did not know, was that Delilah was a spy who worked for the Philistines. When their King heard word of the romance he said:",0
The strong man is caught in our honey trap.,1
"One night, when Samson and Delilah rested in each others arms, she whispered to him:",0
"Tell me my love, what is the source of your great strength?",1
"Samson, fearing betrayal, said:",0
"Tie me with seven green bow strings, and I will be your slave.",1
"While Samson slept, Delilah tied him up with seven green bow strings.",0
She stood back and admired his great limbs bound by the tiny strings.,0
Even his light breathing seemed in danger of breaking them.,0
"Somehow she suspected that he had not told her the truth, and so she put him to the test.",0
She called out:,0
"My love, the Philistines are upon you!",1
"Immediately Samson sat up ready to fight, and as he did he snapped the strings with ease.",0
Delilah laughed because she knew that she had been deceived.,0
The next night Delilah said:,0
"Tell me, oh cunning one, what is the secret of your strength?",1
And do not mock me with your lies.,1
Samson replied:,0
"If you bind me fast with new ropes that have not been used, then I will be quite helpless.",1
"Later, as Samson slept, Delilah tied his limbs with thick new ropes that had never been used before.",0
She pulled the knots tight and this time she was almost sure that he would not be able to escape.,0
"Still, she decided to put him to the test.",0
When he was bound fast she called out:,0
"Oh my love, the Philistines are coming for you!",1
Immediately Samson burst the ropes apart and leapt to his feet.,0
She had been deceived again.,0
This time she did not laugh – she was quite furious with him for tricking her.,0
She knew she must try a different tactic.,0
The next night she upbraided Samson with tears:,0
"How can you say that you love me, when you mock me with your lies?",1
She kept on pressing him for his secret until his soul was vexed almost to death.,0
At last Samson told her:,0
"Shave off my hair and all my strength will desert me, for I have been a Nazarene to God, ever since I lay in my mother’s womb, and a Nazarene is a holy man who must never shave his hair.",1
Delilah knew from the grave way he spoke that this was the truth.,0
"That night, the strong man fell asleep with his head on her lap.",0
At first she caressed him and ran her fingers through his long hair.,0
"For all his strength and wild fury, the handsome giant was totally in her power.",0
"This gave her a sense of thrill, but it was mingled with regret for what she was about to do.",0
"When he was quite asleep, she took a razor from behind the chair, rubbed olive oil into his thick locks, and shaved every single hair from his head.",0
"My Love,",1
she cried.,0
The Philistines are upon thee!,1
"This time she spoke the truth, for she had told the soldiers to come that night and to bring gold with them for her payment.",0
"An armed band of Philistines broke down the door and captured the shaven Samson. He was quite helpless to defend himself, for all his strength lay on the ground with his locks of hair.",0
"The Philistines blinded their prisoner and bound him in chains, before throwing him into their deepest prison cell – and there he rotted.",0
"Some time later, it was the feast day of the Philistine’s god, Dagon. There were great celebrations through the land of the Philistines, for their god had delivered them from Samson’s strength and fury.",0
The King commanded:,0
"Bring him forth from his gaol, and chain him to the pillars of my palace so that we might mock him.",1
This they did.,0
"The house was full of the Lords and Ladies of the Philistine nation and they made sport of the great Samson, the strong man of the Israelites. They threw wine in his face, and poured soup over his head.",0
"Others, still crueler, poked and beat him with sticks.",0
"During the long months when Samson had lain in prison, nobody had noticed or cared what happened to him.",0
"Nobody seemed to understand that as his hair grew back in length, so did his strength.",0
Samson now shook his chains and cried out:,0
"O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me.",1
"I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes!",1
"Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, one with his right hand, and the other with his left.",0
"As he uprooted them from their foundations, his last words were:",0
Let me die with the Philistines!,1
Then the heavy stones of the house came crashing down on the Lords and Ladies of the Philistines and all who were inside.,0
"The Evil Mouse Hello, This is Natasha and I’m here with an old French fairy tale about an evil mouse.",0
"Listen on, if you dare.",0
"One night, a prince and his hunting party rode through a forest by torchlight.",0
The dogs were on the trail of a fawn.,0
"The little creature darted across a stream and hid itself among some bushes, but the pack of hounds did not run her down.",0
"Instead, they stopped by the stream and gathered around something else that they had unexpectedly discovered.",0
The prince rode up and jumped down onto the ground.,0
"He parted his way through the pack, and only now did he see what they had found.",0
A young girl lay by the side of the stream.,0
He knelt down and felt the pulse in her neck.,0
She was alive - just.,0
"Her clothes were simple, but when he held her hand in his, he saw that her skin was fine and white and her nails were carefully manicured.",0
"Lady, wake up, you should not sleep here, there are wild beasts in the forest who may harm you.",1
But she did not awake.,0
"The prince called for his men to cut down some branches, to tie them together, and to make a stretcher.",0
"This they did, and they carried the sleeping maiden back to the castle where the serving maids laid in her a soft bed.",0
An entire day and night went by before she awoke.,0
"When the prince heard the news that she had opened her eyes, he went to her room and knelt down by her side.",0
"Have no fear,",1
"he said,",0
for you are safe here.,1
"As she turned her lovely head towards him, her large eyes filled with tears, and she said, imploringly,",0
"I am truly afraid, but not for the any of the reasons that you might suspect.",0
"The person I fear more than any being, from the natural or the supernatural world, is myself.",0
"Yes, I am the one that I fear, and so should you.",0
Do not trust me.,0
I will not repay your kindness well.,0
"If you are wise, you will turn me out.",0
"Do this, I beg you:",0
send me away from your lovely castle before I do you harm.,0
"The prince smiled and said,",0
"Fair maiden, you do not seem to me like one I should fear.",1
"You’ve been unwell, and you’ve had a bad dream, that is all.",1
Oh I how I wish that it were true!,1
exclaimed the girl.,0
"I will give you my story, and when you have heard it through, tell me then if it sounds like a dream.",1
The prince agreed to her proposal.,0
He settled himself in a chair in the corner of the room and listened to what the young girl had to say.,0
My name,1
", she said,",0
is Rosalie and I am a few days short of my sixteenth birthday.,0
"Until recently, I lived with my good father.",0
"He always treated me gently, and in the main I returned his generosity and kindness with obedience, as a good daughter should.",0
"But there was one occasion when I disobeyed his orders, and oh how I regret my foolish actions!",0
It was my childish curiosity that got the better of me!,0
We lived in a large house surrounded by a lovely garden.,1
"I wandered freely wherever I wished, except to one place where I was forbidden to go.",1
At the bottom of the garden there stood a little shed.,1
"Every morning, before breakfast, my father visited that shed.",1
"When he left it, he locked the door firmly behind him and placed the key in his pocket.",1
"Many times I asked him what was inside the shed, and he always replied:",1
"‘Rosalie, do not ask, and if you respect me, do not try to satisfy your curiosity on this matter.",1
"On no account must you ever go inside the shed.’ ‘Yes father, I promise,’ I said.",1
"And for many years, I kept my word, until one day, after my father left the house wearing his best suit, I noticed that he had placed the key to the shed on the side table.",1
"It was large and rusty, and no doubt would not have fitted easily into his suit pocket.",1
I looked at the key for a long time and wondered:,1
‘Why does father not want me to look inside the shed?,1
"Surely he does not have a prisoner inside there, for he is too kind for that?",1
"And if it were some wild, ferocious beast, would I not hear it roar?",1
"Could it be that I have a relative, some family member, of whom he is ashamed for some reason?",1
Is that possible?,1
"If that is so, I have a right to know, and if I do not take this opportunity to find out, I might never discover the truth of this dark secret.’ And so with great trepidation, I picked up the key and I walked slowly, but determinedly, down the garden path to the shed.",1
"When I reached the wooden building, I turned the key in the lock.",1
"It was stiff, but I managed to release the bolt.",1
"I pushed the door open a little way, and called out:",1
‘Is there anyone inside?’ I thought I heard a little squeaking sound.,1
I put my ear closer to the gap in the doorway and I heard a song:,1
"‘So it’s true,’ I said to myself, ‘here is the unfortunate creature whom my father holds captive.’ Tapping softly upon the door, I said:",1
"‘Who are you, and what can I do for you?’ ‘Open the door, Rosalie!",1
I pray you open the door!’ ‘But why are you a prisoner?,1
Have you committed some crime?’ ‘Alas!,1
"no, Rosalie. An enchanter keeps me here a prisoner.",1
Save me and I will prove my gratitude by telling you who I truly am.’ My hand trembled as I pushed the door fully open.,1
I peered into an apparently empty shed.,1
"Then, I noticed something scuttling across the floorboards towards me.",1
UGHH!,1
It was horrid little mouse!,1
"A dirty gray colour he was, with a disgusting tale like a piece of string.",1
I froze to the spot.,1
The mouse stopped by my foot and looked up at me with his piercing red eyes.,1
"‘Rosalie!’ he said, in his evil little voice, ‘You have delighted me with your foolishness !",1
So it has turned out that curiosity didn’t just kill the cat.,1
It has been the downfall of you and your father.’ I began to sob.,1
"‘What do you mean little mouse?’ I asked, ‘What have I done that is so wrong?’ ‘Nothing!’ exclaimed the mouse, ‘Your disobedience of your father has turned out wonderfully - for me.",1
"I am the fairy who goes by the name of Detestable. It is a name that suits me well, because all who are foolish, gentle and good detest me!",1
HA HA HA!,1
And none more so than your father who turned me into a mouse and imprisoned me in this shed.,1
"Now you have broken your word to him, and you have followed my commands to the letter.",1
"You are in my power Rosalie, and from now on must do all that I say.’ ‘It’s no use,’ squealed the mouse exultantly, ‘You can’t kill me because I’m a fairy, and now you must do as I say.",1
"Go to the fire, light a taper, and burn down the house.’ ‘I shall not,’ I said.",1
But already I felt my resistance was weakening.,1
I could not help myself.,1
"And I admit to you that this part only of my sorry story felt like a dream - I did as the detestable little creature said - I went to the fire, lit a taper, and then used it to set alight to the thatch of the house which overhung the window.",1
"It has been a dry summer, and the roof caught fire quickly.",1
Soon an almighty blaze took hold of the building.,1
‘What have I done?,1
"What have I done?’ I exclaimed, and I ran out of the house, down the garden path, and into the forest.",1
I kept on running through thickets and briars until I came to the stream where you found me.,1
"There, I fell into a deep sleep.",1
Now do you not believe me?,1
Am I not the most disobedient and ungrateful child who ever lived?,1
Does my wickedness not fill you with repugnance?,1
"What are you waiting for, why have you not turned me out?",1
Rosalie. Listen to me.,0
Go to where the gardener has set up a bonfire to burn old leaves.,0
Fetch flames from the fire and burn down this tree.,0
Do as I say Rosalie. Do not resist for you will only tire yourself out if you fight me.,0
You are in my power and have no choice.,0
" And again, as if in a dream, Rosalie did as the little mouse said, and went to fetch the flames.",0
"She set light to the wonderful tree, and surprisingly soon its trunk and branches were a heap of ashes on the ground.",0
"Some little goblins appeared, and following the directions of the mouse, they picked up the precious stones and leaves and carried them off.",0
Rosalie watched on helplessly.,0
"When the goblins and the mouse had disappeared from sight, she sobbed hot tears and tore at her dress.",0
I have betrayed my host who was so kind to me;,1
"the charming prince who, if I had only played my cards right, might have brought me joy and happiness for the rest of my life.",1
Oh what a fool am I !,1
"I should not blame that magical mouse, for he cannot help being evil.",1
It is I who am my own worst enemy!,1
"When she had made this speech, to noone but herself, she ran out of the garden and into the fields behind the castle.",0
"She ran and she ran, this time determined to find a lonely spot where she could fall into one last dreamless sleep.",0
It was not long before the gardener discovered the ashes of the tree.,0
"He informed the prince, who immediately understood that Rosalie was the one who had done this terrible deed.",0
A guard had seen the girl running across the fields.,0
The prince ordered the stable boy to fetch his horse and his best hunting hound.,0
"A maid brought the pillow on which Rosalie had laid her auburn curls, for it bore her scent.",0
The hound was soon on the the trail.,0
"They rode across the field, and out onto the moar.",0
"Some hours later, the prince discovered Rosalie hiding herself behind a boulder.",0
"She had stumbled, twisted her ankle, and could run no further.",0
"I am so sorry, I am so sorry,",1
"she cried out,",0
I could not help myself.,0
 The prince dismounted.,0
"I know,",1
"he said,",0
there’s no need to tell me.,1
An evil mouse commanded you to burn down the tree.,1
"It was a thing of marvelous beauty, planted by my great grandfather, who they say had magical powers.",1
"You don’t believe me, do you?",1
said the girl.,0
"But if your grandfather had magical powers, why is it not possible for an evil fairy to take the form of a mouse?",1
Because,1
", said the prince, but he did not complete the sentence.",0
Just then he noticed a gray little creature sitting on top of the boulder.,0
The mouse was shaking - with laughter.,0
Ha Ha Ha!,1
"said the mouse,",0
Now you too are in my power.,1
Never!,1
"cried the prince, And so saying he drew the sword that had been made years ago by his grandfather.",0
"It was a magical sword that could kill fairies, and with a swipe of its sharp blade he cut off the head of evil rodent.",0
"And that is the story of The Evil Mouse, read by me, Natasha, for Storynory.com Do I have to tell you that Rosalie married the prince and they lived happily ever after?",0
The only trouble they received from mice after that was the sort that could be dealt with by the castle cats.,0
Bertie says that he has based the story on,0
The Little Gray Mouse,1
by The Countess of Ségur.,0
"She was a born in St. Petersburg, in Russia, in the year one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-nine.",0
"Her father was sent into exile, and the family moved to France. The countess wrote a number of novels, as well as a book of Old French Fairy Tales. Bertie has changed this story around a little bit.",0
"In our version, there are fewer fairies, and the state of Rosalie’s mind is more important.",0
"And don’t forget, we have loads more free stories, from all over the world, at Storynory.com.",0
"For now, from me Natasha",0
"All witches have to keep secrets, but Katie’s mother is perhaps too secretive for her own good.",0
The story ends on a cliff-hanger (it’s a bit of a soap).,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Katie and Mr. New Hello, This is Natasha And this is the latest story about Katie, the ordinary witch.",0
Some people have been asking us what ever happened to Katie’s dad.,0
I do seem to recall that we mentioned him in the first story – as well as a family dog – and we’ve forgotten all about them both ever since.,0
Well this story might explain things just a bit.,0
"And by the way, Bertie says that it’s rather more romantic than usual.",0
Katie was just a little bit putout.,0
Her mother was going to the theatre without her.,0
"This was very strange, because Katie and her mum always did everything together.",0
Great-Aunt Chloe came to stay the night.,0
"You wouldn’t want to be a gooseberry,",1
she told a glum-looking Katie.,0
"thought Katie,",0
and I wouldn’t want to be a strawberry either.,1
What strange things my relatives say sometimes!,1
"It was only later, when Katie was lying in bed, that she twigged:",0
Oh I get it.,1
Mum’s found a boyfriend!,1
That’s why she’s been so secretive recently.,1
"A moonbeam did a little dance on the window sill to say,",0
"Yes, Katie, you slowcoach, why didn’t you think of that before?",1
"You see, Katie’s dad had upped and left some years ago.",0
He was a professor at the Institute of Paranormal Phenomena and he thought that his home life was just a bit too much like his work life.,0
So it was probably about time that Katie’s mum found another man.,0
"At breakfast time, Katie said to her mum:",0
How was your evening?,1
"but all she could get out of her was,",0
It was a very nice Midsummer Night’s Dream.,1
It was only two day’s later that Katie’s suspicions were finally confirmed.,0
She was standing in row for school assembly when her best friend Isis whispered:,0
"Katie, is it true that there’s a Mr. New in your mum’s life?",1
"Search me,",1
"said Katie, her cheeks reddening.",0
I’d be the last person she would tell.,1
"Anyway, why do you ask?",1
"But then they had to be silent, because the Headmistress was climbing up onto her podium.",0
"All through the long assembly, full of boring notices and school sports results, Katie fidgeted uneasily.",0
"Eventually, as they shuffled out to the classroom, Isabelle sidled up to her and said:",0
"Katie, everyone except you knows that your mum is going out with an estate agent.",1
An ESTATE AGENT!,1
exclaimed Katie.,0
You really didn’t know?,1
asked Isis rather baffled.,0
"My mum thought you were moving house, because she kept on seeing your mum popping into the estate agent’s office.",1
Then she saw her hanging onto his arm and laughing as they came out of the park!,1
Katie went bright red.,0
"She didn’t know why she felt so humiliated, but she did.",0
"And he’s Indian too,",1
said Isabelle.,0
 said Katie defensively.,0
"Nothing wrong with that,",1
said Isabelle. But there’s plenty wrong with selling houses.,0
My dad says that estate agents are slimy toads.,0
"He says that you can tell if an estate agent is lying, because his mouth is open.",0
You’re romancing an Indian Estate Agent and you don’t say a word to me!,0
The whole school knows about it except for me....,0
"it’s just so, so humiliating!",0
"I’m so sorry darling,",1
"said her mother, quite white with shock.",0
"It’s all very early days, and I didn’t want to say anything because most probably, it will all come to nothing.",1
"Finally, after plenty of hugs and tears, Katie calmed down and said:",0
Ok mum.,1
I forgive you.,1
So tell me about your Mr. New.,1
"Well his name is Shumash,",1
"her mother said,",0
And I like him because he’s very spiritual.,1
A spiritual estate agent?,1
thought Katie.,0
I bet.,1
And then another obvious thought popped into her head:,0
And I don’t suppose you’ve mentioned to him that we’re witches..,1
"Of course not,",1
said her mother pertly.,0
"As soon as a man gets a hint of that, he runs off like a scared rabbit.",1
"He knows I sell magical things of course, but he thinks they are just nice spiritual products – you know, mandrake bath aromas, and and nettle teas.",1
He has no idea about the stuff I keep at the back of the shop.,1
You mean like the broomsticks and packets of frozen spiders?,1
Well yes.,1
"I wouldn’t show him those, would I?",1
Now look Katie. You’ll have to meet him soon.,1
"He’s a really, really lovely man, and I do so hope you will like him.",1
But not a hint of magic!,1
Do you promise faithfully?,1
Katie shuffled and thought :,0
Why would I want to do magic for him anyway?,1
and she said:,0
Yes of course mum.,1
"It was getting towards the end of the Summer Term, and that meant that Sports day was coming up.",0
It was the one school event a year when as many dads as mums came watch and support their children.,0
And It was a time when Katie’s mum felt especially single.,0
She imagined that people were thinking,0
"She’s on her own because she’s a witch, and nobody normal would want to live with her.",1
She made a big decision.,0
She asked Shumash to come with her to Sports Day. Everybody would see him.,0
Nobody could say that he was a secret in her life.,0
"When Katie was lining up to take part in the one hundred metre relay race, she heard someone call out:",0
"Go on Katie,",1
she looked up and saw an Indian man sitting next to her mum:,0
She thought,0
That’s him!,1
"and as she took the baton and ran off she was thinking,",0
He doesn’t look that bad after all.,1
Katie didn’t win any medals.,0
"If she had done, people would have accused her of cheating with magic.",0
"By tradition, the last race of the day was a special one for the fathers.",0
"They all pretended not to care who won, but in fact, some of them were quite competitive about it.",0
"In the weeks before, they had been training in the park, so as to look good in front of their families.",0
Isis’s mum – who was also single – said,0
Shumash – are you going to take part?,1
"and Katie’s mum said,",0
"Yes, Katie would like that,",1
"which just goes to show how quite often, parents don’t understand their children at all.",0
"I’m not really a sportsman at all,",1
said Shumash modestly..,0
"but as two women were urging him on, he agreed to join the line-up.",0
He wasn’t even wearing running shoes – just sandals.,0
"Oh no,",1
thought Katie when she saw him stand up.,0
Please don’t do that.,1
You don’t look like much of an athlete.,1
And you’re not my dad.,1
"Mrs Hepworth fired the starter’s gun, and the dads sprinted off for one lap of the four hundred metre track.",0
At first Shumash looked like he was going to be left behind.,0
"Samantha’s father was out in front, bounding along on long legs, and Susan’s more stocky dad was in second place.",0
"But on the final bend, Shumash started to accelerate.",0
He went past the other runners as if he was flying.,0
You should have seen his face as he ran through the winning tape.,0
He was as astonished as anyone.,0
Katie looked up at her mum in the spectator’s stand.,0
She had never seen her quite so excited and not really very ladylike.,0
She was jumping up and down and waving her fist and shouting,0
"Shumash, Shumash!",1
Oh no!,0
How embarrassing!,0
thought Katie.,0
I don’t know what’s got into her.,1
That’s not like mum at all.,1
Shumash jogged over to Katie and said:,0
"Pleased to meet you, Katie. Your mum’s told me so much about you.",1
"Katie didn’t really know what to say, so she replied:",0
Well done in the race.,1
"I’m sure I wouldn’t run like that normally,",1
he said.,0
You’re mum inspired me.,1
She’s such a special woman.,1
Everything seems to go right for me when she’s around.,1
I trust it does for you too.,1
Katie just smiled.,0
Shumash said:,0
Well lovely to speak to you at long last.,1
Have a blessed day.,1
"And Katie thought,",0
I suppose he said that because he’s spiritual.,1
"After school, Katie said to her mother in the car:",0
"Shumash was very speedy,",1
and her mum smiled and looked happy.,0
I don’t suppose he had any help...,1
mused Katie...,1
of the magical kind.,0
And what other help have you been giving him?,1
He said everything’s been going well for him ever since he met you...,1
"Oh you know, a little nudge along for his business.",1
"When his customers aren’t quite sure about buying a house, a little sprinkling of magic can make up their minds.",1
Katie was horrified :,0
You’d never do that to your own customers!,1
"I know,",1
sighed her mother.,0
I can’t stop myself.,1
He’s just such a nice guy.,1
"Katie shook her head and thought,",0
She can’t help herself.,1
She can only help others.,1
"The following Saturday, Katie’s mum was going to meet Shumash’s family.",0
"Mum, why are you in such a fluster?",1
asked Katie as she watched her mother smudge her lipstick.,0
"Oh I think it’s make or break,",1
she replied.,0
His grandmother is the head of the family and she’s very traditional.,1
I’m not Indian and Shumash is younger than me.,1
I don’t have a dowry...,1
she laughed nervously as she said that...,0
She’ll probably say I’m not right for him.,1
said Katie.,0
"What she says matters a lot to Shumash,",1
replied her mum.,0
"Well just use a little magic,",1
said Katie.,0
Oh I couldn’t do that.,1
"I want her to accept me as I am, not because she’s under a spell.",1
And Katie sighed.,0
She knew her mum was just hopeless.,0
"And she wasn’t entirely surprised when three hours later, she came back through the front door in silence, went into the kitchen, sat down, and burst into tears.",0
Great Aunt Chloe put her arm around her and said:,0
Oh come dear.,1
It can’t have been that bad.,1
What happened?,1
"His Grandmother told him I’m a witch,",1
she said.,0
She knew right away.,1
He’s furious.,1
That you’re a witch?,1
asked Katie.,0
"No. That I didn’t tell him,",1
sobbed her mother.,0
He says he can’t trust me if I keep such an important thing secret from him.,1
"Oh mum,",1
"sighed Katie,",0
If only you knew how to break a secret.,1
"And that’s the story of Katie and Mr. New. For now, from me, Natasha Bye Bye.",0
You can catch up with the earlier parts of our long but exciting story from the time of King Arthur. The Journey of Eric and Enide Eric and Enide rode up and down over the moorland in silence.,0
"After a while the mist and the drizzle began to lift, but it was no clearer to Enide where they were going or why.",0
"Eventually she thought to herself,",0
This is too ridiculous.,1
He must tell me what this is all about,1
So she spoke to her husband but he did not reply.,0
She thought that perhaps he could not hear her because his armour covered his ears.,0
She leaned over and tapped him on the helmet.,0
"His visor was up above his face, but the look in his clear blue eyes was distant and uninterested in her.",0
"My Lord,",1
she said.,0
You told me that we are going on a quest.,1
May I ask just one question:,1
a quest for what?,1
Eric did not tell her.,0
"Instead he said in a weary voice,",0
I ask only this.,1
Ride on ahead and do not say a word to me.,1
"Whatever may happen, whatever you may see or hear, do not speak to me.",1
"Having said that, he clamped the visor of his helmet down over his face.",0
"Enide was not sure if she was more hurt or angered by this response, but she hurried ahead on her pony until she was some way further down the track.",0
"Although she was tired and sad, she kept a sharp lookout for any signs of life or jeopardy.",0
She had heard tales of the strange beings that appeared on the moors:,0
"pixies, ghosts, headless horsemen, wild hounds, and robbers.",0
Soon she realised that her intuition of danger was right – for she saw three knights watching them from the brow of the hill.,0
They started to ride down the slope towards them.,0
They looked far from friendly for they were coming at quite a pace and held lances in their hands.,0
She turned around to look for her husband – but he was riding far behind and did not seem to have noticed the knights.,0
"I must warn him,",1
she said to herself.,0
"He told me not to speak, but this is a matter of life and death.",1
"She kicked her heels into her pony to hurry down the track towards Eric as she called out,",0
My Lord!,1
My Lord!,1
We’re under attack!,1
But Eric did not respond.,0
"When she reached him she said frantically,",0
Don’t you see those three knights?,1
Soon they will be upon us!,1
What do you want me to do about it?,1
he asked.,0
Don’t you recall?,1
I’ve gone soft and effeminate.,1
Oh what are you saying?,1
"Your words, not mine, darling.",1
She calmed herself and tried to reason with her husband one more time.,0
If you insist on arguing then very soon you will be dead and your wife will be taken prisoner by bandits.,1
Is that what you really want?,1
"With a grunt, Eric lifted up his lance and spurred his horse on to meet the attackers.",0
One robber-knight rode out in front of the others;,0
"Eric drove his lance into his shield, and thrust him off his horse.",0
He stabbed the second bandit in the side so that he too fell from his mount.,0
"The third turned and fled, but Eric pursued the robber and caught up with him.",0
They clashed sword to sword and very soon Eric killed his opponent.,0
He gathered the loose horse and rode back to collect the mounts from the two other robbers.,0
"You can walk,",1
"he said to them,",0
"and be glad that you picked on an effeminate knight, or you might have finished up still worse.",1
The defeated robbers looked baffled by this statement.,0
"As they left, Eric ordered Enide not to speak another word, even if the devil himself was coming to attack them.",0
"They rode on, and when they reached the top of a hill, Enide looked down towards a river and she saw some men hurrying to hide in some trees by the track.",0
She was sure that they were robbers and that they were setting an ambush for them.,0
She felt alarmed and confused.,0
Eric had told her not to speak – and yet she must warn him that they were in danger.,0
She remembered that at her wedding she had promised to love honour and obey.,0
"I do love him,",1
"she said to herself,",0
"but if he’s being pig-headed, how can I honour and obey him?",1
Of course I must warn him or we will both die.,1
So she did warn him - and he was furious.,0
Did I not order you to keep silent?,1
he asked.,0
"I give you but one command, and this is how you keep it!",1
"My Lord, you did indeed tell me not to speak, but it is very hard when I see danger up ahead.",1
"Oh faithless woman,",1
he muttered.,0
Then he spurred his horse onto the brow of the hill.,0
"Looking down from there he saw the clump of trees and bushes where the robbers lay in wait, and he charged down towards them.",0
He disappeared into the trees and Enide wondered if that would be her last sight of her husband still alive.,0
"She heard the clashing of swords and shields, the whinnying of horses, and the cries of men.",0
Ten minutes later Eric emerged from the trees leading five horses with empty saddles.,0
"When husband and wife met up again, neither said a word, although Eric seemed to be in better spirits – for no one could doubt his strength and valour after a victory over five men.",0
"That night, Enide stayed awake to keep watch for wolves or robbers.",0
"While she sat by camp fire she looked at her sleeping husband, his broad shoulders, his huge arms and his thick neck, and she thought to herself,",0
"He is certainly brave and strong, and he is often kind and noble.",1
But he was born a prince and has never had anything but praise all his life.,1
Perhaps it is not surprising that there are times when he behaves like a spoilt child.,1
"When the sun rose, they saw that they had camped on the edge of a farm.",0
Soon a boy came across them.,0
He was carrying some food for the farm workers’ lunch.,0
"He hailed Eric and said,",0
Good sir.,1
I see that you and your lady are of noble stock.,1
"Let me take you to my master, for he loves to know when people of note are passing through.",1
He will receive you in his palace and you shall stay in comfort and the best food and drink will restore you.,1
Eric and Enide both gladly accepted the invitation.,0
That day they rested on comfortable beds and in the evening they joined the lord of the manor for a dinner of roast venison.,0
"When Enide saw her host, she recognised him straight away.",0
"His name was Earl Limours, and two years before he had stayed in her father’s house, and had asked for her hand in marriage.",0
Her father rejected him.,0
"He thought his manners were too smooth, and he didn’t trust Limours to take good care of his daughter.",0
Neither Enide or Limours said a word to show that they knew each other – and Enide was afraid that her husband would be jealous if he learned their history.,0
"All evening Limours drank and jested a good deal, for he liked good company.",0
"Eric also drank freely from the wine, though he barely glanced in the direction of his wife.",0
Limours looked her way a good deal though.,0
"When Eric was out of the room, he sat next to her and said:",0
"As he spoke, Enide saw cunning in Limours’ eyes.",0
She remembered that her father had not trusted this man’s charm.,0
"She sat silently, and he whispered to her,",0
Come. I will set you free.,1
Say the word and my men will fall upon your cruel husband while he is unarmed and unsuspecting.,1
"Then we shall at last be man and wife, as it was meant to be.",1
Enide was greatly afraid that one of Limours men would stab Eric in the back before the evening was out.,0
She could see no chance to warn him before they were alone together.,0
"So she answered craftily,",0
"No. It will be bad luck to kill a guest at dinner, and although he is unarmed, he will put up a fierce fight.",1
"Better wait until dawn, and kill him while he sleeps.",1
Limours agreed that Enide’s plan was the safest and the best.,0
"When everyone was ready for bed, he bowed deeply to Eric and wished him the soundest of sleeps.",0
"After Eric and Enide had gone up to their room, he boasted to his men that the lady did not love her careless husband, and had only eyes for him, her first true love.",0
"Enide let her husband sleep a few hours, but she herself did not dare rest.",0
While it was still dark she awoke him and told him what Limours had said and how she had tricked him to win a little time.,0
"Eric thought to himself,",0
So she does love me after all.,1
"Or at least, she prefers me to Limours.",1
"The couple slipped out the palace before dawn, but soon after sun rise, Enide thought she could hear the sound of hooves behind them.",0
She turned saw a cloud of dust bristling with the points of lances.,0
Limours and a large number of his men were after them.,0
"She spoke to Eric,",0
"My Lord, Look back.",1
We are not out of danger yet.,1
This time her husband did not scold her for speaking.,0
He turned his horse and charged towards their pursuers.,0
"Enide thought to herself,",0
Even he cannot defeat an army.,1
Surely this time he will be killed and Limours will force me to become his wife.,1
No. I would rather kill myself than marry that charm merchant.,1
"Limours rode out in front of his men and was the first to meet Eric. They clashed against one another’s shields with lances, and both fell to the ground.",0
Soon they were back on their feet.,0
"Limours swung at Eric with his sword, but Eric ducked under it and cut his opponent on the leg between the joints of his armour.",0
"When Limours men saw their master fall, three of them came at Eric. They were on horse back and he was on foot.",0
"It was only a matter of moments before Eric would surely be dealt a death blow - but the wounded Limours called out,",0
Men stop.,1
Leave him be.,1
My head was hot with wine and passion.,1
I behaved ignobly to a guest.,1
"Let this knight go on his way with his fair lady, for that is how it should be.",1
Enide thought that it was only by a miracle that her husband had survived this encounter.,0
"What she did not know was that Eric had been wounded, and beneath his armour, he was bleeding.",0
"The sun shone down hotly, and the strength in his muscles were evaporating.",0
"Eric was already wondering how much longer he could go on, when they both heard some piteous cries up ahead in some woods.",0
He understood right away that it was the voice of a woman who was in great distress.,0
"Wait here,",1
"he said to Enide,",0
I must go and help.,1
"As he rode on ahead, Enide thought how if anything terrible happened to him, people would say that her husband died while coming to the aid, not of her, but another woman.",0
"Eric found the young damsel – and she told him how she and her fiancé had had been set upon by a giant, and now the cruel beast was dragging him away to his lair.",0
"Whether the beast was to eat him or to demand a ransom from his father, she did not know.",0
"I will return the young man safely to you – or die in the trying,",1
"said Eric. As he rode on, he thought that it might be the latter.",0
"Not far ahead he caught up with the abductor, who was truly a giant – barely able to walk under the trees he was so tall.",0
He was dragging his prisoner along the ground like a sledge.,0
"Eric called out,",0
Ogre. Let him go.,1
"The giant snarled,",0
Make me.,1
"As Eric rode up to him, the giant grabbed his foot and yanked him off his horse.",0
The huge beast brought his his club down onto Eric and dealt him a terrible blow.,0
It was if a boulder had rolled off a cliff onto his head.,0
"Perhaps by chance, Eric tripped the giant and the beast fell onto the point of Eric’s sword.",0
Eric thrust upwards.,0
The creature bellowed like an earthquake and staggered around before thundering onto the ground.,0
Eric was so weak that he was barely able to pick himself up and help the young man onto his horse.,0
In a semi-conscious daze he led him back down the path to reunite the lad with his maiden.,0
"When Eric finally got back to the place where Enide was waiting for him, he was blacking out and seeing only stars in front of his eyes.",0
He fell off his horse with a great crash of his armour.,0
Enide untied his helmet and saw the wound in his head.,0
"She had nothing to wash it with, but her tears - and she felt that his body was frightfully cold.",0
"Oh no, dear husband, do not leave me,",1
she said.,0
Despair came over her.,0
"At noon, a huge red-bearded knight found Enide weeping over the body of her husband.",0
Her grief and tears did not detract from her beauty.,0
"He thought to himself,",0
Here’s the damsel for me - and I am here just in time.,1
This morning she belonged to this pile of limbs that is lying on the road.,1
By this evening she will be mine.,1
"He stepped down from his horse and tried to comfort the beautiful young woman, saying that he would take her back to his castle for protection, and that he was the most powerful man around these parts.",0
"His name was Earl Doorm. Enide refused to leave her husband, but Earl Doorm told his servant to fetch a cart to carry the body back with them.",0
"When they reached Doorm’s castle, Eric’s massive limbs were stretched out on the table of the main hall.",0
Enide sat for long hours by his side weeping and saying his name.,0
"Her words reached into the mind the Eric - for he was not dead, merely in a deep state of unconsciousness.",0
The sound of his wife’s voice brought him back from the brink of death.,0
"His first clear thought was,",0
I love her - and she loves me.,1
But Earl Doorm was growing impatient with Enide. He strutted up and down the hall until at last he pulled her away from Eric’s body and shook her.,0
Tears will not bring him back...,1
Weep no more.,1
The priest is on his way.,1
"First we shall have a funeral, and then a wedding straight after.",1
"No, No,",1
"cried Enide,",0
I shall always love my Lord Eric. I shall never love another man so long as I live.,1
Eric heard these words but his eyes remained closed.,0
Foolish woman!,1
cried Earl Doorm.,0
Don’t you see?,1
You are mine now.,1
Yours?,1
she said in amazement.,0
Never!,1
You shall be my wife within the hour.,1
"And you will learn to obey me even sooner,",1
"cried Doorm, and with that he struck her on the face.",0
"Eric rolled off the table onto his feet and punched the Earl. Doorm staggered backwards, as much shocked as hurt, and Eric’s second blow laid him out flat.",0
They were surrounded by the Earl’s guards who looked on in amazement thinking that Eric was a ghost.,0
"One of them called out, ""The dead knight is risen!"" Another said,",0
It’s the devil himself.,1
"And third cried,",0
It’s the Apocalypse!,1
Eric led Enide by the hand into the courtyard where they found a scene of complete panic with soldiers and servants running this way and that from the spectre of the dead knight.,0
Only a young serving maid kept hold of her senses.,0
"She did not believe in such nonsense as ghosts, and she hated the Earl with all her heart.",0
She fetched a horse for Eric and Enide and wished them God’s speed.,0
"Enide climbed up behind Eric, clasped her arms around him, and once more they rode away...",0
And they kept on riding over the hills until they met a knight.,0
What is your name?,1
Called the stranger.,0
Are you friend or foe?,1
Eric did not reply because he was still too feeble to speak.,0
"Tell me your name,",1
"called the knight again,",0
or I shall challenge you.,1
"Enide realised that if Eric did not reply, the other might take him for a robber.",0
"She called out,",0
"His name is Eric, Prince of Devon and he is grievously wounded.",1
What is your name?,1
"I am Kay, a knight of King Arthur,",1
replied the other.,0
The name of Prince Eric is held in great esteem by myself and all the knights of the round table.,1
"Now pray, follow me.",1
King Arthur was camped not more than a mile away.,0
"When he heard that Prince Eric had arrived and was seriously wounded, he brought him to rest in his own tent.",0
"Serving maids washed Eric’s wounds with a healing ointment concocted by the wizard Merlin. He rested for three days, and all the time Enide stayed by his side.",0
For a long while he did not speak.,0
"When at last he opened his eyes he said,",0
We have found the object of our quest.,1
And what is that my dear?,1
"asked Enide. And he replied softly,",0
Love.,1

"Introducing Mandy, Laura and Sam - the three members of the latest chart topping girl band, the chiX. This is the story of how it all began, before they were famous.",0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Have you ever wanted to be lead singer in a band?,0
"I mean, have you ever picked up an old cardboard toilet roll, held it to your mouth, and pretended that it was a microphone?",0
Or have you ever found yourself tapping out a beat on the kitchen table with a couple of felt-tip pens?,0
Or come up with a great new dance in front of the mirror?,0
I bet you have because almost everyone has...,0
Everyone except Gladys. She had never done anything like that.,0
She was much too clever to mistake a toilet roll for a microphone.,0
But her three older sisters had all done it.,0
"Their names were Mandy, Laura and Sam, and all three of them loved dancing, and while they were dancing, they secretly imagined that they were on TV and everyone was watching them.",0
"They also dreamed what it would be like to be really, really famous.",0
"When they went to school, the kids on the bus would say:",0
"Hey girls, you were great on TV last night.",1
Only they probably wouldn’t go on the bus to school anymore.,0
The record company would give them a black stretch limo as long as the street and with dark windows.,0
That’s how they would go around once they were famous.,0
"One Saturday night, all four sisters were squashed together on the couch watching the Eurovision Song contest.",0
"If you don’t know what the Eurovision Song Contest is, that’s probably because you live in Mexico or somewhere twenty time zones away from Europe. In fact Gladys remarked:",0
"I wish we lived somewhere like Mexico or Alaska, and then we wouldn’t be able to watch this trash.",1
But Laura said:,0
I expect all the Mexicans watch it on the Internet.,1
"And Gladys had to admit that she hadn’t thought of that, because although she was the brainiest, she couldn’t always think of everything.",0
"Well Mandy, Laura and Sam liked watching it – There was a Danish man dressed up as woman, a Norwegian flamenco dancer, and a rugged Moldovian with blond hair extensions.",0
They were just funny.,0
The only band really worth seeing was from Ukraine. The singers were three beautiful but mean-looking girls with straight black hair falling over their white faces.,0
You know what?,1
Said Mandy.,0
I bet we could do that.,1
"We could be just as good as them, and be on the Eurovision Song Contest. In fact, I bet we could win it.",1
"Only the UK never get any points,",1
said Gladys.,0
"Well neither can they,",1
said Mandy.,0
"Besides, Laura has a great voice.",1
Everyone says so.,1
Gladys still thought it was a silly idea so she said:,0
"But Laura wears a tracksuit and gold bangles, even when she’s going out with her boyfriend.",1
You can’t dress like that if you’re on TV.,1
"Well, said Mandy, ",0
"when we’re famous, all the top designers will send us free gear, so Laura won’t have to wear a tracksuit unless she feels like it, like when she wants to go shopping and not get noticed by all the fans.",1
"Beside, you aren’t in this band, because you’re too young.",1
"And too geeky,",1
"added Laura. Gladys hadn’t really thought about being in the band, but when they said that she wasn’t in it, she felt, well, a bit left out.",0
It wasn’t fair.,0
She could play the piano.,0
"If anyone was going to form a band, it ought to be her.",0
"Well at least I know how to read music, which is more than any of you lot,",1
she said.,0
So you’ll have to have me in your band because you won’t know what tune to sing.,1
Laura scoffed:,0
Ah come off it who’s ever heard of a band that knows how to read music?,1
We’re not the church choir!,1
"Now go and play computer games like a good little geek, while we get ready to be famous.",1
"Yeah go on G-lady,",1
said Sam.,0
Stop annoying your older and better sisters.,1
"You aren’t in the band anyway, and it’s time to tuck your dollies up in bed.",1
"It was particularly annoying when Sam spoke like that, because she was born only a year and a half before Gladys, but she looked a lot older, especially when she put on make-up, so somehow people took her more seriously.",0
"I haven’t got any dollies,",1
"said Gladys as she left the room,",0
unlike you darling Samantha. You’ve still got six!,1
"Besides, your band hasn’t even got a name – so it’s not a band at all.",1
Goodnight.,1
"On Sunday afternoon, Gladys spent a lot of time on her homework, because she was working on a big project about Ancient Egypt and she had to research the pyramids on the Internet. Her three older sisters watched the music channel on TV and tried to copy some of the dance routines.",0
How about the Smith Sisters?,1
"Said Mandy. You see, their name was Smith.",0
Boring!,1
Said Laura.,0
Or the Teddy Girls?,1
Suggested Sam. Because they lived in a place called Teddington.,0
"Too babyish,",1
said Mandy. Dad was there for a while.,0
He had got wind of this idea about forming a band – though nobody had actually told him about it.,0
"He said,",0
How about the Rich Girls?,1
Because he was hoping that they would pay for his retirement.,0
"The girls took no notice of him, however - they never did, so he went out to the front drive to fix his motorbike, which was how he usually spent Sunday evenings.",0
"While they were talking, Gladys had been trying to imagine a name that both sounded good, and looked good when it was written down – like on a poster or an album cover.",0
"When the others went quiet, she said:",0
"I think, ",0
"chiX, spelt with a small c and a big X, because it’s a Chick Band and X looks like a kiss.",1
"Yeah, or like, ",0
"Leave me alone,",1
"which is cool,",0
But I bet there’s already a girl band called the chiX because it’s too good.,1
Mandy searched iTunes and YouTube and she couldn’t find any other band with that name.,0
"They couldn’t think of anything else, so their name just sort of became 'chiX.' But somehow they didn’t quite remember that it was Gladys who had come up with it.",0
It was just like they had always been the chiX ever since they were born.,0
Now all they needed was a song - but of course they didn’t have one.,0
A week went by and the chiX almost got forgotten.,0
"Then next Saturday, when Dad came home from the football match, he said:",0
"Hey girls, how’s your band going.",1
Have you got a gig fixed up yet?,1
"Of course they haven’t got a gig,",1
said Gladys.,0
They haven’t even got a song.,1
"Oh go on Mandy, do sing it to me, pretty please.",1
"I’m sure it’s such a lovely song,",1
said Gladys. And Mandy looked annoyed.,0
Well don’t cry.,1
I’ll write you some words.,1
How could you write the lyrics for a song?,1
asked Laura.,0
You don’t know anything about relationships.,1
You’re too young.,1
Can anyone really tell the difference?,1
Asked Gladys. But that gave her an idea to work on.,0
"So she went up to her room, sat down at her desk and scribbled down a few ideas.",0
Later she came to the living room and switched off the television.,0
Her sisters started to say:,0
"Ah come on Glad, what was that for?",1
But she took no notice.,0
She stood in front of TV and read out her words:,0
"Not bad,",1
"said Laura,",0
but sharp doesn’t rhyme with heart.,1
Well what do you want it to rhyme with?,0
Harp?,0
"Besides it’s an internal rhyme, and I’ve got a chorus...",0
Download the Audio of Big Sister’s Clothes The big sister was called Debbie. And the little sister was called Daisy. Debbie was seven.,0
And Daisy was four.,0
"And most of the time, they were great friends.",0
"Even when Daisy broke some of Debbie’s toys, she didn’t mind too much.",0
And most of the time Daisy didn’t mind being the little sister.,0
"But just occasionally, it made her very cross indeed.",0
And this story is about one of those days.,0
A modern story specially written for Storynory.  Read by Natasha. Duration eleven.thirty minutes.,0
It started out a pretty ordinary sort of day.,0
"It was the holidays, and there was no school, so as soon as the two girls got up, they started playing.",0
They played with their dolls in their room.,0
"They went down to breakfast, and played with their eggy soldiers.",0
And then they went out to the garden and played on the swings.,0
And Daisy decided it was shaping up into quite a nice day.,0
Because the thing she really like best of all was playing with her big sister.,0
But then it all started to go very wrong.,0
"Come on Debbie,",1
said their Mum.,0
It’s time to go to Girl Guides.,1
"Me come too, me come too,",1
"said Daisy, jumping up and down.",0
"Don’t be silly,",1
said Mum.,0
You have to be seven to join the girl guides.,1
Daisy felt a bit cross about that.,0
"Still, it would be fun when Debbie got home.",0
"But when Debbie did get home, she didn’t have any time to play.",0
She had to work on her school project.,0
Can I work on my school project?,1
asked Daisy. But Mum just laughed.,0
"Don’t be silly,",1
she said.,0
You don’t even go to proper school yet.,1
And Daisy felt a bit cross about that as well.,0
"After that, it was time for bed.",0
"I’ll take you up,",1
"said Dad, picking Daisy up off the sofa.",0
What about Debbie?,1
said Daisy.,0
"She can stay up later,",1
said Dad.,0
Because she’s the big sister.,1
"And that, thought Daisy, is that.",0
Now I’m really cross.,0
"Really, really.",0
"It’s not fair,",1
she wailed.,0
When am I going to be the big sister?,1
Dad paused for a second.,0
"Well, never,",1
he said.,0
"Debbie’s always going to be the big sister, and your always going to be the little sister.",1
"But, but, but....",1
But Daisy was so cross she couldn’t even finish the sentence.,0
"That’s just the way it is,",1
said Dad.,0
"Night, titch...",1
"said Debbie. And after that, Daisy sat in bed.",0
"And she felt so, so, so angry, she felt she might explode.",0
"Never be the big sister, she thought to herself.",0
It’s just not fair.,1
She was just about to close her eyes when suddenly she saw a fairy at the bottom of her bed.,0
Who are you?,1
she asked.,0
The fairy skipped across to Daisy’s pillow.,0
"I’m the age fairy,",1
she said.,0
The age fairy?,1
asked Daisy.,0
What’s that?,1
And then it dawned on her.,0
Can you...can you help little sisters who really want to be big sisters?,1
The fairy nodded.,0
But only if they really want to.,1
"I really do,",1
said Daisy.,0
"Really, really.",1
And so the fairy skipped into the wardrobe.,0
"She waved her wand, and then she pointed to a red dress.",0
"I’ve turned that into Big Sisters Clothes,",1
she said.,0
"Just put on that dress, and suddenly you’ll be the big sister, and Debbie will be the little sister.",1
And then the fairy vanished.,0
"And as she closed her eyes and went to sleep, Daisy was wondering what it might be like be the big sister for a change.",0
"She was a bit frightened, but also excited...because big sisters seemed to have so much fun.",0
The next morning Daisy woke up early.,0
"She was really excited about being the big sister, so she snuck into the wardrobe and put on the red dress.",0
And suddenly she was the big sister.,0
"Oh-my-gosh,",1
she said.,0
This is so amazing.,1
She whirled around a little bit.,0
And then she saw that Debbie was waking up.,0
And Debbie was the little sister.,0
"I want to play with you, said Debbie, holding out her favourite Barbie doll.",0
But just now Daisy wasn’t sure she wanted to play with Debbie. She was enjoying being seven a bit too much.,0
"In a minute,",1
she said.,0
I want to play with you NOW!,1
"shrieked Debbie. And then Dad walked into the room, carrying a cup of coffee and a newspaper.",0
"And Debbie was crying and crying about how she wanted to play with her big sister, and stamping her foot, and going bright red in the face.",0
"We, er, just play with her for a bit will you Daisy,",1
said Dad. But Daisy didn’t really want to.,0
"But, er, Dad...",1
"Great, thanks,",1
"said Dad, walking out of the room.",0
And so Daisy had to play with her little sister just to cheer her up.,0
"Daisy, Daisy, where are you?",1
"shouted Mum, running into the room.",0
What?,1
said a startled Daisy.,0
"You haven’t taken the dog out,",1
shouted Mum.,0
She’s barking and barking.,1
"So Daisy put on her coat, and walked outside with the dog.",0
"But the dog was quite strong and was pulling her this way and that, and she was feeling quite cold.",0
"So she was relieved when she got inside, because she was really hungry now and needed some hot breakfast.",0
"Sorry,",1
"said Debbie, when Daisy arrived at the table.",0
I thought you’d gone out so I ate your eggy soldiers.,1
"Wha, wha, whaaaaaaat!",1
screamed Daisy.,0
"Now don’t argue girls,",1
said Mum.,0
"But she ate my breakfast,",1
shouted Daisy.,0
"Well, she’s only small, she can’t help it,",1
said Mum.,0
I’ll get you some museli instead.,1
"I don’t like muesli,",1
grumped Daisy.,0
"Well, you have to eat it because you’re a big girl, and you have to eat healthy foods.",1
"I want a chocolate milk shake,",1
said Daisy.,0
"Don’t be silly,",1
said Mum. And so Daisy had two spoonfuls of muesli but she really couldn’t eat any more than that because it was yucky.,0
"And when she had finished, she thought she would go out on the swings to play.",0
"Where are you going, young lady,",1
said Mum.,0
"To the swings,",1
said Daisy.,0
"Not until you’ve tidied your room,",1
said Mum.,0
Done what?,1
Daisy was shocked and horrified.,0
She never tied her room....not ever.,0
"Go on, quick,",1
said Mum. So Daisy trudged upstairs.,0
"And on the bedroom floor, Debbie had pulled lots of toys out of their boxes and spread them everywhere.",0
And now Daisy had to pick them all up.,0
"It’s so unfair,",1
she said out loud.,0
"Finally she was finished, and she went back downstairs.",0
Maybe at last she could go out to the garden and play.,0
What about your project?,1
said Dad.,0
My...my....,1
But Daisy was speechless.,0
"It has to be finished by today,",1
said Dad.,0
"Just a minute,",1
said Daisy firmly.,0
And she went back upstairs to her bedroom.,0
She went to the wardrobe.,0
And she took off the red dress.,0
And put on a little girls dress instead.,0
So that suddenly she was the little sister again.,0
"I want to play with you,",1
"she said to Debbie, when she went back downstairs again.",0
"Oh, I’m busy now,",1
said Debbie.,0
"That’s okay,",1
said Daisy sweetly.,0
I’ll go and play in the garden by myself.,1
She played by herself for the rest of the morning.,0
And decided that being the little sister wasn’t so bad after all.,0
Could you live without your technology?,0
What would you do without your digital games?,0
Princess Beatrice thinks that Bertie spends far too much time lying on the couch and playing games on his tablet.,0
Sounds familiar?,0
She takes him on holiday to the Land that Time Forgot where all modern technology is banned.,0
How will Bertie manage?,0
"Story by Bertie Read by Natasha. Bertie in the Land that Time Forgot - Throughout the long years that Bertie was a frog, he had missed out on so many things:",0
like the new Angry Insects Game and the threeD Vampire movies.,0
"In fact, back in the time when the Wicked Queen made him green and amphibious, iPads had not even been invented yet.",0
"It’s hard to imagine that world, isn’t it?",0
"As soon as he became a human prince, he made up for lost time.",0
"He quickly got to level three hundred in Droid Rush, and his island on DigCraft was the most spectacular you ever saw.",0
Almost everyone was impressed by Bertie’s rapid progress at gaming.,0
"But not Beatrice. She thought that Bertie spent far too much time lying on the sofa with his tablet, and not nearly enough time in the real world with her.",0
"There were days when she thought that quite frankly, he might as well still be a frog because when she tried to speak to him, he just stared at her blankly and said,",0
"Croak,",1
before going back to his game.,0
"When it came to picking a summer holiday, Bertie was happy to leave that to Beatrice.",0
"This is where I want to go,",1
she said as she handed him a brochure.,0
"It was painted on thick paper, almost like card, and the colours were all slightly faded.",0
"Its title, in Gothic letters, announced:",0
Bertie turned the pages.,0
"There were pictures of horse-drawn carts, penny-farthing bicycles, fat policemen, steam trains, and people wearing flouncy hats and plus-four trousers.",0
Is this some sort of time travel?,1
"Asked Bertie, who was willing to believe that anything was possible.",0
"Not exactly,",1
"replied Beatrice,",0
but it’s a bit like going back in time.,1
It’s a whole kingdom that has decided to go back to old fashioned ways.,1
"They’ve banned modern motor cars, mobile phones, game consoles, and television, and processed food...",1
and all the things that make life hectic and distracting and stressful.,1
"People go there to detox, you know, get all that sort of stuff out of their system – because quite frankly, some people are addicted to their gadgets, games and gizmos.",1
And what would we do there?,1
"asked Bertie, puzzled.",0
"Well instead of playing Angry Insects on your tablet, you could talk to me and go for romantic walks,",1
"said Beatrice. Bertie knew that his fate was sealed, and he had to make the best of things.",0
He decided to surprise Beatrice by becoming a proper old fashioned prince just for the holiday.,0
He bought some shirts with cufflinks and collars that you fasten on with studs.,0
"He found a blazer with gold buttons, and he grew a moustache which he waxed so that it was all twirly.",0
"All motor vehicles made before one thousand, nine hundred and seventy were banned from the kingdom.",0
But Bertie found a vintage motorbike in the garage that had belonged to his uncle.,0
"The mechanic got it working, and polished it with wax so it was all shiny.",0
Beatrice sat behind Bertie. They took their luggage in a sidecar.,0
He gave the bike a kick start and the engine roared.,0
They rode to the Land that Time Forgot with plenty of spluttering and clattering – and Beatrice loved every minute of clinging to Bertie’s waist and feeling at one with the world as it rushed by.,0
"When they reached the border post, the soldiers on guard went through their luggage searching for any illegal modern gadgets.",0
Luckily they did not discover that Bertie had a mobile phone and charger sewn into the lining of his leather jacket.,0
They drove over rugged mountains to the capital city.,0
"Once they were there, they bumped over cobbled streets past iron railings, gateways guarded by stone lions, houses built out of large stones – under arches, and through squares where fountains played.",0
Sometimes the narrow way was blocked by a horse and cart.,0
"Almost everyone they saw wore a hat of some sort – as it was a holiday place, straw boaters were popular.",0
"The cars were black and squarish, but ever so beautiful.",0
"They felt quite at home in the hotel, because it was like a palace.",0
Its marble and crystal and panelled walls made it even more opulent than they were used to.,0
"The beds were covered in pillows, so they could have great cushion fights.",0
The bath was so big that you could swim in it.,0
Bertie could hide behind the giant curtains and jump out and surprise Beatrice when she came back from the bathroom.,0
"In the day they visited the cathedral and the art gallery, and watched the changing of the guard outside the King’s palace.",0
In the evening they went to the ballet.,0
A beauty and health spa was tucked away inside the basement of the hotel.,0
"Beatrice booked herself in for a steam bath, followed by a massage, a facial, and a manicure and pedicure.",0
Her beauty pampering would take all morning.,0
Bertie stayed up in their suite of rooms.,0
"He told Beatrice that he was going to read War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, but in fact he did not manage more than a few pages before he started to think about the mobile phone he had smuggled across the border.",0
He took out his nail scissors and carefully cut open the lining of his motor bike jacket.,0
"He did not expect it to function as a phone while they were in the Land that Time Forgot, but the games were all working fine.",0
Soon he was happily zapping space invaders.,0
"But oh dear, Beatrice returned sooner than expected.",0
She had not enjoyed the treatment.,0
"The steam room was so cold you could catch a chill, and the masseur should have been an all-in-wrestler.",0
She was in a bad mood when she stormed into the room and said:,0
Bertie!,1
What are you doing?,1
Bertie looked up guiltily.,0
"Just phoning my Aunt Gertrude to see how she is,",1
he lied.,0
No you’re not.,1
"You’re playing games,",1
said Beatrice angrily.,0
"I’m confiscating that,",1
and she snatched the phone off him and put it in her silk purse.,0
How did the king know we were here?,1
asked Bertie.,0
We are booked into the hotel using false names.,1
"Well I told him we were coming,",1
said Beatrice.,0
He’s my uncle.,1
"You kept that quiet,",1
said Bertie.,0
"I thought you might not approve,",1
said Beatrice blushing.,0
You mean he’s the brother of the Wicked Queen?,1
"Well you know, all royals are one big family, and he’s really very nice,",1
said Beatrice.,0
"Hmm, I would not call somebody who stops you using a mobile phone nice,",1
said Bertie. Then it was Beatrice’s turn to sulk.,0
They both had to cheer up in time for lunch at the palace.,0
Beatrice’s uncle Ferdinand wore a white uniform emblazoned with medals and had a neat grey beard so that he looked a little bit like the last Tsar of Russia. The meal was served on the terrace overlooking the river and they watched steamboats and pleasure cruisers sailing past.,0
Beatrice praised the food.,0
"It’s such a joy to eat tomatoes which really taste like tomatoes, and new potatoes that are bursting with flavour.",1
"Everything from the supermarket at home is so bland and same-y,",1
she gushed.,0
"This breed of potato is named in my honour,",1
boasted their host.,0
"They are called King Ferdinands, and it will be my honour to decree that the tomatoes be named after my darling niece...",1
From henceforth they shall be called Princess Beatrices.,1
Beatrice was delighted with the compliment from her uncle.,0
Bertie asked Ferdinand why he had decided to turn his kingdom into the Land that Time Forgot.,0
"I thought it was good marketing,",1
he replied.,0
These days small kingdoms have to differentiate themselves in the market otherwise they just get over-shadowed by bigger and flashier holiday destinations.,1
You mean it was a business decision?,1
"said Beatrice, disappointedly.",0
I thought it was more because you were into traditional values and conserving the past.,1
"Oh no, just scratch the surface and you’ll find a very modern kingdom,",1
said Ferdinand.,0
"It all looks old fashioned, but underneath this is the most technologically advanced theme park in the world.",1
It is?,1
"said Bertie, surprised.",0
"Oh yes, rather,",1
said Ferdinand.,0
Have you seen the changing of the guard?,1
All the soldiers are computer generated in threeD. It’s the cheapest army to run in the whole world!,1
We don’t have to pay for a single tin of boot polish.,1
said Bertie. Even Beatrice was impressed.,0
"It turned out that all the works of art in the gallery were also electronic fakes, and that the steam trains and even some of the horse drawn carriages were all operated by a sophisticated computer system.",0
"Many of the buildings were actually built with virtual reality blocks and then projected onto screens, but they looked so real you could never tell unless you tried to walk into them.",0
"As for the real tasting tomatoes and potatoes, they were all developed in the laboratory.",0
And the roast beef was made out of genetically modified soya beans.,0
"Bertie enjoyed the dessert, because it was a light, fluffy and bright concoction that tasted of strawberries and was made from a packet of powder and whipped up with condensed milk.",0
"As they thanked their host, he asked an awkward question:",0
"By the way, how’s my sister?",1
"He meant of course The Wicked Queen. Bertie blushed slightly and said,",0
Oh we don’t talk to her much now.,1
"She’s a frog, you know, and lives in the pond.",1
"I heard,",1
said Ferdinand darkly.,0
"That wasn’t very nice of you Bertie, was it, to go turning your future mother in law into a piece of pondlife.",1
"I did no such thing,",1
said Bertie.,0
I’m not a magician.,1
"First she turned me into a frog, and then when I became human again, she turned herself into one by accident.",1
Serves her right too for being so wicked.,1
"Well it has come to my attention that you have broken the laws of our kingdom by smuggling a mobile phone across the frontier,",1
"said Ferdinand. And when Bertie heard those words, he felt a sense of foreboding – like he had walked into a trap.",0
He glanced at Beatrice. She bit her lip and looked anxious.,0
"The king ordered Bertie to empty his pockets, and when that did not turn up the illegal phone, he told the guards to search him.",0
"We shall have to search your room a second time,",1
he said.,0
Bertie realised that their room was being searched while they were at lunch.,0
He thought what a good thing it was that Beatrice had confiscated his phone.,0
But oh no!,0
Just then there was a loud De De De DEEEEEEE!,0
Bertie’s phone was ringing in Beatrice handbag.,0
"Excuse me,",1
"said Beatrice, as cool as a cucumber.",0
She opened her bag and answered it.,0
It was a sales agent who was giving a courtesy call to see if Bertie wanted a better deal on his palace’s insurance policy.,0
"Er he’s not here right now,",1
said Beatrice and hung up.,0
"Guards, arrest the princess,",1
ordered the king.,0
And two soldiers came up and placed strong hands around her arms.,0
"No, don’t arrest her.",1
Arrest me!,1
"It’s my phone,",1
"protested Bertie. But King Ferdinand laughed and said,",0
"That was my plan, Bertie, but now I see it is better to detain the princess.",1
"If you want her back, you shall have to restore my sister to her former glory.",1
"But I’ve no idea how to do that,",1
said Bertie.,0
She’s stuck as a frog for a few years at least.,1
"You’ll find a way,",1
said Ferdinand.,0
My soldiers will escort you to the border.,1
"Go back home and unfrog her, or you will never marry your darling lovey dove’y princess.",1
Bertie don’t do it!,1
called out Beatrice.,0
She’s too wicked.,1
The world is far better off with her on the pond.,1
"I don’t think I could even if I wanted to,",1
"said Bertie, crestfallen.",0
"A day and half later, Bertie returned home alone, and feeling very angry.",0
"He had to rescue Beatrice, but short of declaring war on the Land that Time Forgot, how could he force Ferdinand to release her?",0
"He was so down, he did not even want to play computer games.",0
"His cyber-friend Prince Sven, was messaging him, challenging him to a round of Space Dragons. He had never actually met Prince Sven, but they played games online together.",0
He tried to ignore Sven but his phone kept on buzzing with messages.,0
Eventually Bertie opened up his chat app and wrote:,0
Can’t play today.,1
Fiancée got arrested while we were on holiday.,1
Trying to sort it out.,1
Might have to declare war.,1
"Cool,",1
messaged Sven back.,0
Have you ever tried Cyber War?,1
"No time for games right now,",1
replied Bertie.,0
"This is no game,",1
wrote Sven.,0
I mean Cyber War for real.,1
The first indication that all was not right in the Land that Time Forgot came when diners at the hotel started sending their food back to the kitchen.,0
"They complained that the King Ferdinand potatoes smelled like rotten cabbages, and the chocolate pudding tasted of beetroot.",0
"Then visitors to the art gallery no longer found French Impressionist paintings on the walls, but action comic strips about super heroes.",0
The ballet was taken over by hip hop dancers.,0
"The soldiers outside the palace, instead of changing the guard, linked arms and did the French Can Can. A horse and cart puffed out stinky purple exhaust fumes.",0
Rococo Buildings turned into glass and concrete sky scrapers.,0
One of them took off like a rocket and whizzed around the sky like some sort of berserk firework.,0
The traffic lights went crazy and traffic jams of vintage cars clogged up the cobbled streets.,0
Police sirens were wailing everywhere.,0
"The once tranquil capital city was loud, smelly and congested.",0
King Ferdinand was on his mobile phone trying to get through to technical support.,0
"All the lines were engaged and he was listening to bland elevator music, getting more and more furious by the minute.",0
Eventually he got through to his Chief Technical Office who gasped:,0
"Sorry Sir, we are under attack!",1
What sort of attack?,1
"Asked the king, desperately.",0
Cyber attack sir.,1
"As soon as we close one gap in our firewall, another one opens.",1
They just keep coming and coming at us.,1
We are doing everything we can but this is a massive offensive against us.,1
"It’s all out war, Sir.",1
Ferdinand was on the balcony of his room.,0
He was so shocked that it took him a minute or so to notice that an army of giant frogs were hopping across the forecourt and invading the palace.,0
The croaking was deafening.,0
It was terrifying.,0
The windows of the palace were rattling.,0
Ferdinand’s hands were trembling.,0
Ambassadors and Foreign ministers were constantly calling.,0
Overseas governments were flying in planes to evacuate tourists.,0
Worse still – holiday agents were cancelling bookings and demanding their money back.,0
"Then suddenly, just as the frogs were bursting through the front door of the palace and guards were running for their lives, the attack stopped.",0
All the virtual attackers disappeared.,0
Glass and concrete turned back to stone.,0
Hip hop dancers were ballerinas once again.,0
"And joy of joys, the puddings tasted of chocolate.",0
De-De-De-Deeee Fedinand’s mobile phone rang.,0
"Hi there, it’s Bertie,",1
said a familiar and rather annoying voice.,0
"Do you give up, or shall we resume the cyber attack?",1
What do you want?,1
asked the king.,0
"Just my fiancée back, please,",1
said Bertie.,0
Because there is one thing in this world that is real and can never be recreated in virtual reality – and that is love.,1
"We learn a new side to Katie’s mother in this magical adventure which takes us to Morocco, and Marrakesh, the magical capital of the world.",0
One astute listener recently said she liked our Katie stories because Katie’s mum is such a good role model.,0
In most children’s stories (she said) the parents are portrayed as dopes.,0
"Not in our Katie stories, as you will find out.",0
(And thanks to Natasha for encouraging Bertie to develop the character of Katie’s mother).,0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha.  Katie and the Magician of Morocco..,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. It wasn’t that often that Katie’s mum said,",0
"I’ve got some good news darling,",1
but that’s just the phrase that came tripping off her lips when she met her at the school gate.,0
"They had to hurry to the car, because she had parked on a yellow line and had left the shop closed while she came to pick up Katie. It was only when they were on their way that she revealed the details:",0
We’re going on holiday ...,1
to Morocco.,1
"That’s wonderful,",1
"said Katie, and then:",0
How can we afford it?,1
"We can afford it,",1
"said her mother,",0
because a rich and famous witch came into the shop and asked me to find her a flying carpet.,1
She is paying for us to go to Marrakesh for a few days to look for one.,1
Oh Mum!,1
exclaimed Katie.,0
I dreamed that something good like that would happen to us soon!,1
"And, we can find some other magical things for the shop while we are there,",1
continued her mum with excitement that was unusual for her:,0
Marrakesh is the magical capital of the world.,1
Of course the magic shops are secret.,1
We’ll have to find somebody to help us.,1
"But, I’m sure that won’t be too hard.",1
"After all, we are witches.",1
"Two weeks later, Katie and her mum flew to Marrakesh. They went by plane, because it’s an awfully long journey to go by broomstick, and besides, Katie hadn’t passed her flying test yet.",0
"As they came down the steps of the plane, the evening air felt surprisingly chilly.",0
Katie had expected Africa to be warmer.,0
Katie’s mum explained:,0
They say Morocco is a cool country with a hot sun.,1
It will heat up in the day.,1
The airport bus took them to the city.,0
The reddish-pink walls of Marrakesh welcomed them in.,0
Dusty palm trees wafted the hot tempers of drivers stuck in traffic jams.,0
Mules argued with motorized rickshaws.,0
"The air smelt of oranges, spices, and petrol fumes.",0
The bus dropped them off just outside the Medina...,0
which is like a little city within a city ...,0
a maze of streets and alleys.,0
"They would never have found the guest house on their own, but there was no shortage of porters with wooden trollies who were only too ready to ferry their luggage and show the way.",0
"One of these led them through the allies, under ancient archways and past dilapidated walls, little shops, tiny squares, and stray cats, to a door that looked just like all the others in the Medina. You could hardly have guessed that behind lay a beautifully tiled courtyard with a fountain and potted palms.",0
How wonderful!,1
exclaimed Katie.,0
Was that a magic door we just stepped through?,1
said Katie’s mum.,0
It’s just a nice surprise!,1
"Their room inside the traditional house, known as a riad, was up on the second floor, overlooking the courtyard.",0
"When they had rested and washed, they took a map and found their own way to the great square of Marrakesh known as Djamaa El Fna. The sound of Dmamaa El Fna is one of the greatest cacophonies of the world.",0
"It is a clashing din of store-holders cries, snake charmers Kazoos, storytellers tales, musicians, twangs, and general hubbub.",0
"Although it was night time already, the food stalls were a blaze of little light bulbs.",0
It seemed like the whole of Marrakesh had come here for supper and was sitting down on the benches under the canvas roofs.,0
"Katie and her mum found soups and stews flavored with figs, and cooked in earthenware pots called tagines.",0
"And none of this is magic, it’s just normal life?",1
asked Katie.,0
"Well, there may well be some magic on the square,",1
"said her mum,",0
But most of this is just normal life.,1
"In the morning, they explored the souk, which is the huge market in the Medina. You could wander all day through alleyways and streets, and look at the stores overflowing with pots and pans, clothes and fabrics, spices and dried fruits.",0
But nowhere was there a sign of a magic shop.,0
"We really need a guide, somebody who knows the secret places,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
And Katie wished hard that somebody would come and help them.,0
"A few minutes later, while Katie’s mum was examining a lovely piece of fabric, a man came up to her and said:",0
"Madam, you are beautiful like a gazelle!",1
"Let me be your guide for you, and your lovely daughter.",1
"No thank you,",1
"said Katie’s mum, who was always suspicious of flatterers.",0
We are alright on our own.,1
Katie thought that perhaps her mum was being too hasty.,0
Her witch’s intuition made her feel certain that help was near at hand.,0
They went inside the shop and her mum asked the sleepy looking owner.,0
Do you have anything magical?,1
"Madam, only your eyes are magical things in this market.....",1
"Well, thank you,",1
"said Katie’s mum, who really wasn’t open to flattery, but secretly felt quite pleased by the remark.",0
"As they stepped outside, another man stood close by and said very quietly....",0
"Excuse me Madam, did I hear you are looking for magical things?",1
"Well yes,",1
she replied.,0
You did hear correctly...,1
And Katie just knew that they had found their magical guide.,0
"He was young with quick intelligent eyes, and a little mustache.",0
"Like many people in the Medina, he wore a long loose robe, with a hood and wide sleeves.",0
Katie’s mum looked doubtfully at him:,0
"He just wants to take us to his own shop,",1
she said.,0
Katie felt quite embarrassed by her mum’s unusual lack of tact.,0
But the man was not put off.,0
"My name is Omar,",1
he said.,0
I know all the special magic places.,1
Let me take you to them.,1
"Oh come on Mum,",1
"said Katie,",0
At least he hasn’t praised your eyes or said you look like a gazelle.,1
"Well that’s true,",1
"said Katie’s mum with a sigh, and scrutinizing Omar through her dark witchy eyes:",0
Can you show us where they sell magic carpets?,1
"Certainly,",1
"said Omar, and he lead them on through the winding passages, past the slippers and cloths, the painted urns, and the baskets of spice.",0
They came to the part of the market that was full of carpet shops.,0
"Only one of these has magic carpets,",1
"said their guide,",0
and you can be sure that I know which it is.,1
"He took them into a place around a corner, and a little away from the rest.",0
An old man sat peacefully on a stool.,0
He did look kind of magical.,0
The guide greeted him very politely and spoke to him.,0
The old man snapped his fingers and a boy appeared.,0
He sent him to fetch a large carpet which he unrolled on the floor.,0
"It is very old,",1
said the shopkeeper.,0
"It does look lovely,",1
"said Katie, admiring the zigzags and arches that were patterned on it.",0
Does it fly?,1
asked Katie’s mum.,0
"Oh no Madam, but it does some have some very nice magic.",1
"If you lie down on it for one hour a day, you will be thin and even more beautiful, by the end of the month.",1
"It is much better than going for runs or not eating nice food, don’t you think?",1
"Well, it would be,",1
"said Katie’s mum, trying not to laugh,",0
but actually it’s a flying carpet that I am looking for.,1
"I must tell you the truth,",1
said Omar.,0
This man does not have a flying carpet.,1
But what else would you like to buy?,1
"I will find it for you, Inshallah.",1
What does Inshallah mean?,1
asked Katie.,0
"God willing,",1
said her mum.,0
And then turning back to Omar:,0
"If you can find me a good supply of something pretty and magical, I can buy plenty of them for my own shop back home, Inshallah.",1
"Oh Madam, it is a pleasure to help a lady of business.",1
We will find twenty magic coffee pots at a very nice price for you.,1
"And soon they were in the part of the market where the copper makers worked, sitting on stools as they hammered out trays and pots.",0
"This special shop has a very nice pot,",1
said Omar.,0
You see the little bird who sits on the top of it.,1
He is the bird of wisdom.,1
"If you make your coffee from this pot everyday, you will become very wise.",1
"If your daughter drinks from it, she will pass all her exams.",1
"I’m afraid our customers back home are tea drinkers,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
Omar bowed.,0
Never fear.,1
"I have just the thing for you, Madam,",1
he said.,0
Follow me.,1
"As they made their way through the illuminated alleys, Katie whispered:",0
"Mum, do you believe anything he says about magic?",1
and Katie’s mum replied:,0
Everything he’s shown us so far is fake.,1
"But my witch’s intuition tells me that he does really know where to buy some magic things, and he’s just holding it back.",1
"That’s good, because I got that feeling too,",1
said Katie. Finally they reached the slipper market.,0
Here you could choose from thousands of lovely pointed slippers with charming patterns on them.,0
"But, according to Omar, only one of stores sold magic footwear.",0
"When you feel tired put on these slippers, and you will be refreshed within fifteen minutes,",1
he claimed.,0
"That’s a nice idea,",1
"sighed Katie’s mum,",0
but not everyone where we live will believe that.,1
"In fact, we have laws against selling things that make big claims that can’t be proved.",1
What we need is something that nobody can doubt is magic – like a flying carpet for instance.,1
That’s really what I came to Morocco to find.,1
"I am sorry to be difficult, but are you sure you can’t find us a real flying carpet?",1
"Madam,",1
"said Omar,",0
"I see that you are a wise lady, and that you know in your heart what you want.",1
"Inshallah I shall find it for you, but not in this market.",1
Meet me tomorrow at seven in the morning.,1
I shall take you to a very secret place in the mountains where they make magic flying carpets.,1
"That sounds more promising,",1
said Katie’s mum brightly.,0
But only real flying carpets mind you – none of that close your eyes and fall asleep and dream you are flying business....,1
I want truly magical elevation.,1
"You shall see real magic, Madam,",1
"said Omar,",0
Inshallah.,1
The next day they met Omar by the taxi rank.,0
He had hired a dusty old car.,0
"They drove out of the reddish pink coloured city, and up into the matching reddish-pink coloured Atlas mountains.",0
"They saw goats climbing up trees to munch the leaves, and terraced fields pushing up grass between the stones.",0
"The higher they went, the dryer the land became.",0
It was steep and full of pebbles.,0
"But on the peaks of the mountains, they could see snow.",0
"Eventually the car pulled onto the side of the road, and Omar said:",0
Now we must walk.,1
It is the only way to reach the secret village where they make the magic carpets.,1
"Fortunately, Katie and her mum had both brought thick soled hiking boots.",0
"They drank plenty of water as they tramped along the stony path, with the hot reddish-pink sun beating down on them.",0
Eventually they reached a tiny village.,0
It seemed to appear like magic.,0
Perhaps it was magic.,0
Omar lead them into a house.,0
"This is my grandmother and my grandfather,",1
said Omar. And Katie and her mum said how pleased and honoured they were to meet the friendly old couple.,0
Katie’s toes tingled.,0
She knew that they had magic powers.,0
They sat down on cushions on the floor.,0
"The old lady brought them tea in little glasses, and sweet cakes on a tray.",0
"Omar spoke at length to his grandparents, and at one point appeared to be almost arguing with them.",0
Katie guessed that they did not want to show their magic secrets to strangers.,0
"After a while, the old man disappeared into the back of the house, and brought back a small carpet which he unfurled on the floor.",0
"His wife spoke some words, in a commanding sort of way, and the carpet began to rise up a few inches above the ground and hover.",0
The old man put his tea glass on it – as if it were a table – and he laughed.,0
They all smiled and Katie clapped.,0
"Thank you,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
This is what we came to Morocco to find.,1
Is it for sale?,1
Can we agree a price?,1
The grandfather named a price.,0
"It was rather high, and Katie’s mum shook her head.",0
"He named another price, slightly lower, and she still shook her head.",0
"I’m sorry,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
"I love the carpet, but it’s too high.",1
I can’t sell it for that much back home.,1
"When Omar translated this, the price came down even lower and they had a deal.",0
"Katie was pleased, because she really wanted to take that carpet back home and try it out before they gave it to the rich old witch who had sent them to Morocco. Now that the deal was done, the atmosphere became relaxed.",0
"The old man wanted to know all about their shop back home, and what sort of prices people paid for magical things.",0
But while they were chatting some visitors came into the house without asking.,0
"One of them was a tall, thick set man, with grey hair and a squarish head.",0
He held a thick stick in his hand.,0
Katie felt his magic powers.,0
They were strong and aggressive.,0
He pointed his stick at her mother in a threatening sort of way.,0
Omar looked frightened and said:,0
This is the village elder.,1
He wants you to go with him.,1
"We shan’t,",1
said Katie’s mother.,0
He is a very powerful magician.,1
"You must do as he says,",1
said Omar.,0
"We can do magic too,",1
answered Katie. Omar shrugged his shoulders and held his hands up as if to say:,0
"Get real,",1
which he might have said if he knew English slang.,0
Katie tried not to cry.,0
Her mother put her arm around her.,0
There were several other men crowding into the little house now.,0
They had no choice but to go with them.,0
There were lots of people out on the street now.,0
They were talking excitedly and some people were shouting.,0
"They were led into another house, and a little room without a window.",0
The door was bolted behind them.,0
What will happen to us?,1
sobbed Katie. Her mother comforted her and said soothingly.,0
Don’t worry darling.,1
It’s going to be all right.,1
I promise.,1
"An hour later, Omar brought them some tea and oranges.",0
"I am very sorry,",1
he said.,0
The village elders are angry that I brought you here.,1
This is a very secret place.,1
They do not want outsiders to know about our magic.,1
"I realised that,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
What do they mean to do with us?,1
"The village council will decide tomorrow morning,",1
said Omar.,0
I am afraid you must stay the night here.,1
"When he had left them alone, Katie said:",0
Do you think they will murder us?,1
"I don’t know, and I don’t intend to find out,",1
said her mum.,0
"We will wait here until it’s dark, and then we’ll leave.",1
"A few hours later, it was completely dark in the room, and uncomfortably cold.",0
"All was deathly quiet, except for the occasional bark of a village dog.",0
Katie’s mum got up and felt her way to the door.,0
"She tapped it very lightly with her fingers, and Katie heard the bolts fall off onto the ground on the other side.",0
"They pushed the door open, and crept through the house onto the street.",0
A dog came running towards them.,0
"Katie’s mum waved her arms with a downward motion, and the dog lay down on its tummy.",0
"Good doggie,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
Then she tested the air with her long finger.,0
"I sense the most powerful magic is coming from that house on the other side of the street,",1
she said.,0
"So do I,",1
agreed Katie. Her mother beckoned at the house.,0
The door opened and a carpet flew out towards them.,0
It stopped on the ground at the feet of her mother.,0
The village elder was at the door of the house looking surprised.,0
"Hop on quick,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
And Katie stepped onto the carpet and crouched down.,0
Hold on tight to my waist,1
"said her mum, and soon they were flying forwards, a few feet above the road, at quite a fast pace.",0
"As they rushed along, they were also rising into the air.",0
Katie looked round:,0
"That nasty man’s got onto a carpet too,",1
she exclaimed to her mum.,0
Faster!,1
"commanded her mum, and the carpet started to accelerate.",0
The night air was rushing through Katie’s hair.,0
Patches of snow were glinting blue on the surface of the Atlas Mountains. Katie could see the minarets of a high altitude mosque.,0
But the thuggish village elder was catching up on them.,0
Soon he was raising his stick and pointing it at their backs.,0
Katie wondered if it could shoot them in some sort of way.,0
Her mother turned round and pointed her finger back at their pursuer.,0
Halt,1
she commanded.,0
"Oh no,",1
thought Katie.,0
His carpet doesn’t obey mum’s voice.,1
Or perhaps her spell can’t reach that far back.,1
"But actually, the magician’s carpet was slowing down.",0
The man started to beat the carpet with his stick.,0
His face was furious as he glided to a standstill in midair.,0
"He will be stuck there for at least and hour,",1
said her mum cheerfully.,0
"Their own carpet sped on through the night air, but the magician raised his stick at the fleeing witches.",0
Katie could feel its cold shadow on her back.,0
"She cringed, feeling that she was about to be hit with a powerful magical force.",0
She was sure that she and her mother would go tumbling down to the ground at their doom.,0
she cried.,0
Her mother turned round and snapped her fingers.,0
The stick flew out of the magician’s hand and spun off into the sky towards the stars.,0
"And after that, Katie and her mother enjoyed a pleasant flight back to Marrakech. Fortunately it was a dark night, and not many people saw them land on the roof of their riad.",0
Those that did probably thought they were dreaming.,0
Katie’s bed never felt so warm and comforting as that night.,0
"They got up late the next day, and had a lazy breakfast on the terrace.",0
Katie’s mum bought a few nice but not particularly magical things in the Medina. They took a bus to a lovely seaside town and stayed there for a few days.,0
"Katie’s mum bought a magic coffee pot there, that really did do magic things, like make coffee without being put on the stove.",0
And she bought some crystals that could stop you getting colds.,0
But mostly they did things like swimming in the sea and horse riding along the beach.,0
"When they returned to Marrakech at the end of the week, they bumped into Omar in the Medina.",0
"I am glad to see you,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
I was afraid the village elders might take things out on you.,1
"They wanted to,",0
" said Omar, ",0
"But now they are afraid of me, because I know a powerful witch like you.",1
"That’s right,",1
said Katie’s mum.,0
"If anyone threatens you, tell them they will have to deal with me.",1
"I will Madam,",1
"said Omar, with a sly grin.",0
"And the following morning, Katie and her mum took the plane back home, with the flying carpet in their luggage.",0
It’s all very strange indeed.,0
But perhaps it’s not quite so extraordinary when you know that Isis went to the same school as Katie. by Nicholai Gogol. Story by Bertie. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Loads of people are always saying that Isis is an exceptionally pretty little girl.,0
They say things like:,0
What lovely blonde hair she has!,1
What wonderful blue eyes!,1
Such a sweet nose!,1
What a darling little mouth!,1
And Isis likes it when people say such things about her.,0
And there’s something else that makes her happy – it’s that everyone at school wants to be friends with her.,0
"In fact, she’s so popular that every girl in her class is simply dying to go to her birthday party.",0
But Isis couldn’t invite just anyone to her party.,0
"And especially, she couldn’t invite Katie. You see, Katie was a bit strange.",0
And not very pretty.,0
Well at least Isis thought so.,0
And she didn’t like the way she did her hair.,0
And her shoes weren’t very nice.,0
And Isis couldn’t possibly invite a girl who wasn’t pretty to her party.,0
So she didn’t.,0
But Katie has a secret that Isis didn’t know.,0
"Only very few people, like Wendy and Alisa, know Katie’s secret – but I’ll let you in on it.",0
"Katie is a witch, and can do all sorts of magic spells.",0
She tries not to do them too often – or else everyone will soon know her secret.,0
"One day, Isis came to school with invitations for all the girls in her class to come to her party.",0
All except for Katie. And Katie felt a bit sad about that.,0
"Because although she wasn’t best friends with Isis, she felt, well, rather left out.",0
It made her feel like there might be something wrong with her.,0
"The next day, some of the girls were talking about Isis’s party.",0
Samantha said:,0
"I’m not sure what colour dress to wear, but I think I might go in pink.",1
said Trudy.,0
Pink suits you so well.,1
"When Katie walked past, Julia said:",0
I expect that Isis didn’t invite Katie because she’s got a nose like a pug.,1
Katie heard this and she spun round:,0
I do not have a nose like a pug!,1
she said.,0
"And even if I did, Isis has a nose that points upward – and that means that she’s a snooty-nose.",1
But the girls just laughed at Katie and they all chanted:,0
"Later,  when Isis heard that Katie had called her a snooty nose, she was cross.",0
"In fact, she was really, really, really cross, because she knew that there was a little grain of truth in it – and a true insult hurts more than an untruth.",0
"Her nose did point up just a bit – but even so, she still thought it was the prettiest nose in the class.",0
When she saw Katie she said:,0
How dare you call me a snooty-nose?,1
You just said that because I didn’t invite you to my party.,1
Well I’ll tell you Katie why I didn’t invite you.,1
"I didn’t want you there because my mum says that your mum is weird and that your whole family is ugly, especially you!",1
"I’m glad that you didn’t invite me,",1
said Katie.,0
Because I wouldn’t have come anyway.,1
"And besides, your nose does point up and that’s because you and your whole family are snooty.",1
Your family is so snooty that they named you after an Egyptian Goddess – and if you look at a picture of the real Isis you’ll see that she had a pointy-up nose too.,1
"Isis is a very pretty name,",1
said Isis.,0
At least it’s not a common name like Katie. You’re more common than a tin of baked beans.,1
"In fact, there’s nothing pretty or clever about you.",1
You’re not even funny.,1
"You’re just dumpy, flat-nosed Katie, with stringy black hair, bandy legs, and wonky teeth.",1
"And besides, nobody likes you because there is nothing special about you at all.",1
Not one thing – apart from the fact that you smell.,1
"And Katie was so cross that she started to mutter a magic spell to turn Isis into a snail – but then she thought that she had better not, in case she got into trouble.",0
"So that night, before she went to sleep, Katie sat up in bed reading her magic books.",0
"She was looking for a very special spell to get her revenge on Isis. And at last, just before her mum came in to kiss her goodnight, she found the perfect spell for the job.",0
"In the morning, Isis got out of bed and went to look at her face in the mirror.",0
She was just a bit worried because she thought she might be getting a spot on her nose – and that wouldn’t do at all.,0
"In fact, she had decided that if her nose got a pimple, she wouldn’t go to school until it went away.",0
"But when she looked in the mirror, what she saw was not at all what she had been fearing.",0
"It was much, much worse.",0
It was her nose.,0
"Or rather, it wasn’t her nose.",0
Because it wasn’t there any more.,0
Isis had no nose.,0
Her face was just flat where her pretty little snooter should have been.,0
She let out a scream!,0
And then another scream.,0
And then another.,0
Her mother came rushing up the stairs.,0
And then she screamed too.,0
"When they both stopped screaming, they looked under the pillow and in the folds of the duvet.",0
Then they looked under the bed and in the cupboard.,0
"But nowhere, could they find her nose.",0
Then her mum wrapped a scarf around her daughter’s face and took her to the doctor’s.,0
The doctor said not to worry.,0
Isis wouldn’t die because she could still breathe through her mouth.,0
"But he said it was strange, very strange indeed.",0
He had never seen anything like it.,0
"He gave her a bottle of pink medicine just in case it might help, but on balance he thought it probably wouldn’t.",0
And then Isis cried.,0
And she cried.,0
And she cried some more.,0
Because she couldn’t possibly go to school without her nose.,0
And she would have to cancel her party.,0
"And so long as she was noseless, she wouldn’t be popular.",0
Because nobody would want to know a girl with no nose.,0
"In class, the teacher said that Isis had had an accident and wouldn’t be coming to school until she was better.",0
"When Katie heard this, she knew that her spell had worked, but of course she didn’t tell a soul about it.",0
"After school, Julia and Annabelle went round to Isis’s house to see if she was ok.",0
"Nobody answered the door, so they went around the back to see if she was playing outside on the lawn.",0
They saw her sitting on a garden chair.,0
And they both saw her face.,0
"But of course, what they didn’t see was her nose.",0
"After that, the news about Isis losing her nose spread fast around the school.",0
Everybody was talking about it.,0
And then some very strange things started to happen.,0
Really strange things indeed.,0
"When the art teacher, Miss Jenkins, opened her desk, she found inside it – a nose.",0
It was a pretty little nose but slightly pointed up at the end – just like Isis’s.,0
She thought it was a joke-nose that somebody had made out of play-dough.,0
And that made her very cross.,0
"It really isn’t very nice at all,",1
she said.,0
"In fact, who ever did this has an extremely nasty little mind.",1
It’s ever so cruel to make fun of somebody who’s had an accident!,1
Everyone wondered who had made the joke nose.,0
But in fact nobody had.,0
Because it really was Isis’s nose.,0
"And when Miss Jenkins wasn’t looking, the nose climbed out of her desk, hopped onto her chair, and jumped down onto the floor.",0
"You see, it had grown two little legs and it could run.",0
Toby spotted it – and he yelled out:,0
"Look Miss, Look!",1
Look!,1
There it goes.,1
The nose is escaping!,1
It’s running away.,1
But Miss Jenkins didn’t look.,0
She didn’t even believe him.,0
She just went over to Toby and told him that he was a very naughty little boy and that he was in big trouble.,0
"In fact, she was going to ring his mother and tell her just what a mean and horrid thing he had done.",0
Nobody else saw the nose escaping – except for Katie – and she kept quiet.,0
"She felt a bit sorry for Toby, but not too much, because she knew that very soon more people would see some strange things.",0
And they did.,0
"When Samantha opened her locker, she screamed so loud that the whole school heard her – because Isis’s nose had been asleep on top of her fleece, and when she opened the door it sprang up and jumped out of the locker.",0
"And when Annabel looked in the mirror, she saw that her face had two noses – her own and Isis’s – and they seemed to be having a conversation with each other.",0
Annabel didn’t even scream – she just fainted.,0
"When she came round, Isis’s nose had scarpered – and none of the teachers believed what she told them.",0
They just said that she must have imagined it.,0
And Toby found the runaway nose once again.,0
"This time, it was taking a nap in his lunch box.",0
"He was so frightened that he would get into even more trouble than before, that he didn’t tell anyone.",0
"He just grabbed the nose and let it loose in the playground where it ran off, no doubt to make more trouble elsewhere.",0
"At the next staff meeting, Mrs Hepworth, the headmistress, was in one of her flurries.",0
What on earth are we going to do about all this nose business?,1
The whole school has been traumatized by Isis’s terrible accident.,1
All the children are imagining things.,1
It’s a mass hysteria.,1
A mass hysteria is when lots of people see the same thing which isn’t really true.,0
"Like the Indian rope trick, when a man appears to climb up a rope that isn’t attached to anything.",0
By now Katie had enough revenge.,0
Perhaps too much.,0
And she truly wished that she could send the naughty nose back to Isis’s face.,0
"But the trouble was, she couldn’t find out how to reverse the spell.",0
"She had found it in a very old book of magic, and some of the pages were missing – including the one with the reverse nose spell on it.",0
A few days later she saw Isis in the supermarket – well she didn’t actually see her face because Isis had wrapped a scarf around it.,0
"In fact, she looked like she was going out in a snow blizzard.",0
Isis saw Katie – but she pretended not to.,0
She felt ashamed that her nose had run away.,0
"And Katie felt, well, rather sorry for her, and just a bit guilty.",0
So that evening she asked her mum if she knew where the missing pages from the old spell book were.,0
"Oh yes, those.",1
"They’re in my desk,",1
said Mum.,0
But there’s nothing very useful in them – unless you want to charm a runaway nose back to its owner.,1
"I had to learn that spell for the Witch Masters Course at University. The professor said it had only been used once, and that was one hundred and fifty years ago in the city of St. Petersburg when it was still the capital of Russia.",1
"But Katie said that she liked reading old spells, and besides, you never knew when they might come back into fashion.",0
"And that night, she learnt two sets of magic words.",0
Both were very complicated.,0
One for catching the runaway nose.,0
And the other was for sticking it back onto its owner’s face.,0
"The nose didn’t want to be caught, but Katie found it living in the school kitchen where it could sample plenty of nice food smells.",0
"She said the magic words that she had learned off by heart, and it hopped into her hand.",0
She wrapped it in a handkerchief.,0
And then she went round to Isis’s house.,0
Isis’s mum answered the door and said that her daughter didn’t want to see anyone.,0
"But Katie told her that she had important news about the whereabouts of the runaway nose, and eventually she was allowed up to Isis’s room.",0
Isis hadn’t seen any friends for three whole weeks.,0
"In fact, she was actually quite pleased that someone had come to see her – although she hid her face behind a pillow so that her visitor couldn’t see her face.",0
"It’s very nice of you to come round,",1
she said from behind the pillow.,0
None of my friends want to see me anymore – not even my nose wants to see me.,1
"It ran off, you know.",1
At least you are no longer the most unpopular girl in school.,1
"I am, and I suppose that serves me right for being so mean to you.",1
And Katie said:,0
You were mean to me.,1
But I was meaner to you.,1
"You see, it was me who told your nose to run away.",1
said Isis.,0
Yes me.,1
But now I’ve brought it back to you.,1
"And Katie took out a handkerchief, unfolded it, and put the nose on the bed.",0
"Oh gosh, golly golly gosh.",1
It is my nose.,1
"Oh pretty little nose, why did you run away from me?",1
And the nose said:,0
I ran away from you because you were boring.,1
"Me, boring?",1
"But, but ...",1
"I was the prettiest, most popular girl in school.",1
And didn’t you go on about it?,1
"In fact, you went on, and on, and on, about how wonderful you were.",1
So I got bored and ran away.,1
"It was was ever so mean of you to run away,",1
said Isis.,0
I had to cancel my own birthday party.,1
But Katie was getting fed up with all the talk.,0
She put her foot down and said:,0
It’s high time for you two to get back together.,1
And no arguments.,1
"And with that she picked up the nose, said a magic spell, and she stuck it back on Isis’s face.",0
Katie looked at Isis and checked that she had put her nose back on straight.,0
She had.,0
"Then she noticed that while it had been away, the nose had grown a bright red pimple because it hadn’t been eating all its vitamins.",0
Isis looked in the mirror and saw the pimple.,0
But do you know what?,0
She didn’t even care because she was so glad to have her nose back.,0
The next day she went to school.,0
Everyone crowded round to welcome her back.,0
And nobody minded that she had a pimple on her nose.,0
"In fact, Samantha said that nobody would have minded even if she had no nose at all – because there was more to life than to have a perfect face.",0
"In fact, being true friends was much more important than how anyone looked.",0
And Isis said:,0
I want you all to come to my party next week.,1
Especially Katie because now she’s my best friend.,1

The young elephant hero is full of questions.,0
Why is his tall uncle the giraffe so spotty?,0
Why are the eyes of his broad aunt the hippopotamus so red?,0
"Above all, he wants to know what the crocodile has for dinner.",0
And in the end we learn how the elephant got his trunk.,0
Read by Natasha. The duration is twenty-five minutes.,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. The Elephants Child - In the high and far-off times the elephant, O best beloved, had no trunk.",0
"He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side;",0
but he couldn’t pick up things with it.,0
"But there was one elephant–a new elephant–an Elephant’s Child–who was full of satiable curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions.",0
"And he lived in Africa, and he filled all Africa with his satiable curtiosities.",0
"He asked his tall aunt, the ostrich, why her tail-feathers grew just so, and his tall aunt the ostrich spanked him with her hard, hard claw.",0
"He asked his tall uncle, the giraffe, what made his skin spotty, and his tall uncle, the giraffe, spanked him with his hard, hard hoof.",0
And still he was full of satiable curtiosity!,0
"He asked his broad aunt, the hippopotamus, why her eyes were red, and his broad aunt, the hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad, broad hoof;",0
"and he asked his hairy uncle, the baboon, why melons tasted just so, and his hairy uncle, the baboon, spanked him with his hairy, hairy paw.",0
And still he was full of satiable curtiosity!,0
"He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him.",0
And still he was full of satiable curtiosity!,0
One fine morning in the middle of the precession of the Equinoxes this satiable Elephant’s Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before.,0
He asked:,0
What does the crocodile have for dinner?,1
Then everybody said:,0
Hush!,1
"in a loud and dreadful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.",0
"By and by, when that was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird sitting in the middle of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said:",0
"My father has spanked me, and my mother has spanked me;",1
all my aunts and uncles have spanked me for my satiable curtiosity;,1
and still I want to know what the crocodile has for dinner!,1
"Then Kolokolo bird said, with a mournful cry:",0
"Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out.",1
"That very next morning, when there was nothing left of the Equinoxes, because the precession had preceded according to precedent, this satiable Elephant’s Child took a hundred pounds of bananas (the little short red kind), and a hundred pounds of sugar-cane (the long purple kind), and seventeen melons (the greeny-crackly kind), and said to all his dear families:",0
"Goodbye. I am going to the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to find out what the crocodile has for dinner.",1
"And they all spanked him once more for luck, though he asked them most politely to stop.",0
"Then he went away, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not pick it up.",0
"He went from Graham’s Town to Kimberley, and from Kimberley to Khama’s Country, and from Khama’s Country he went east by north, eating melons all the time, till at last he came to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, precisely as Kolokolo bird had said.",0
"Now you must know and understand, O best beloved, that till that very week, and day, and hour, and minute, this satiable Elephant’s Child had never seen a crocodile, and did not know what one was like.",0
It was all his satiable curtiosity.,0
The first thing that he found was a bi-coloured-python-rock-snake curled round a rock.,0
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child most politely,",0
but have you seen such a thing as a crocodile in these promiscuous parts?,1
Have I seen a crocodile?,1
"said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake, in a voice of dreadful scorn:",0
What will you ask me next?,1
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child,",0
but could you kindly tell me what he has for dinner?,1
"Then the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake uncoiled himself very quickly from the rock, and spanked the Elephant’s Child with his scalesome, flailsome tail.",0
"That is odd,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child,",0
"because my father and my mother, and my uncle and my aunt, not to mention my other aunt, the hippopotamus, and my other uncle, the baboon, have all spanked me for my satiable curtiosity–and I suppose this is the same thing.",0
"So he said good-bye very politely to the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake, and helped to coil him up on the rock again, and went on, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not pick it up, till he trod on what he thought was a log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees.",0
"But it was really the crocodile, O best beloved, and the crocodile winked one eye–like this!",0
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child most politely,",0
but do you happen to have seen a crocodile in these promiscuous parts?,1
"Then the Crocodile winked the other eye, and lifted half his tail out of the mud;",0
"and the Elephant’s Child stepped back most politely, because he did not wish to be spanked again.",0
"Come hither, little one,",1
said the crocodile.,0
Why do you ask such things?,1
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child most politely,",0
"but my father has spanked me, my mother has spanked me, not to mention my tall aunt, the ostrich, and my tall uncle, the giraffe, who can kick ever so hard, as well as my broad aunt, the hippopotamus, and my hairy uncle, the baboon, and including the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake, with the scalesome, flailsome tail, just up the bank, who spanks harder than any of them.",1
"And so, if it’s quite all the same to you, I don’t want to be spanked any more.",1
"Come hither, little one,",1
"said the crocodile,",0
"for I am the crocodile,",1
and he wept crocodile-tears to show it was quite true.,0
"Then the Elephant’s Child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said:",0
You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days.,1
Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?,1
"Come hither, little one,",1
"said the crocodile,",0
and I’ll whisper.,1
"Then the Elephant’s Child put his head down close to the crocodile’s musky, tusky mouth, and the crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.",0
"I think,",1
"said the crocodile–and he said it between his teeth, like this",0
I think today I will begin with Elephant’s Child!,1
"At this, O best beloved, the Elephant’s Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this:",0
Led go!,1
You are hurtig be!,1
Then the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake scuffled down from the bank and said:,0
"My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster",1
(and by this he meant the crocodile),0
will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson.,1
This is the way bi-coloured-python-rock-snakes always talk.,0
"Then the Elephant’s Child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch.",0
"And the crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled.",0
And the Elephant’s Child’s nose kept on stretching;,0
"and the Elephant’s Child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching;",0
"and the crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant’s Child’s nose grew longer and longer–and it hurt him hijjus!",0
"Then the Elephant’s Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long:",0
This is too butch for be!,1
"Then the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant’s Child’s hind legs, and said:",0
"Rash and inexperienced traveller, we will now seriously devote ourselves to a little high tension, because if we do not, it is my impression that yonder self-propelling man-of-war with the armour-plated upper deck",1
"(and by this, O best beloved, he meant the crocodile),",0
will permanently vitiate your future career.,1
That is the way all bi-coloured-python-rock-snakes always talk.,0
"So he pulled, and the Elephant’s Child pulled, and the crocodile pulled;",0
but the Elephant’s Child and the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake pulled hardest;,0
and at last the crocodile let go of the Elephant’s Child’s nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo. Then the Elephant’s Child sat down most hard and sudden;,0
but first he was careful to say ‘Thank you,0
What are you doing that for?,1
said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake.,0
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child,",0
"but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink.",1
"Then you will have to wait a long time, said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake.",0
Some people do not know what is good for them.,1
The Elephant’s Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink.,0
"But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint.",0
"For, O best beloved, you will see and understand that the crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all Elephants have today.",0
"At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.",0
You couldn’t have done that with a mere-smear nose.,1
Try and eat a little now.,1
"Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant’s Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his fore-legs, and stuffed it into his own mouth.",0
Vantage number two!,1
said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake.,0
You couldn’t have done that with a mear-smear nose.,1
Don’t you think the sun is very hot here?,1
"It is,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.",0
Vantage number three!,1
said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake.,0
You couldn’t have done that with a mere-smear nose.,1
Now how do you feel about being spanked again?,1
"Scuse me,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child,",0
but I should not like it at all.,1
How would you like to spank somebody?,1
said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake.,0
"I should like it very much indeed,",1
said the Elephant’s Child.,0
"Well,",1
"said the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake,",0
you will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with.,1
"Thank you,",1
"said the Elephant’s Child,",0
I’ll remember that;,1
and now I think I’ll go home to all my dear families and try.,1
So the Elephant’s Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk.,0
"When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do.",0
"When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do.",0
When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as fly-whisk;,0
"and he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot.",0
"When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands.",0
"He went especially out of his way to find a broad hippopotamus (she was no relation of his), and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the bi-coloured-python-rock-snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk.",0
"The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo–for he was a Tidy Pachyderm. One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said:",0
How do you do?,1
"They were very glad to see him, and immediately said:",0
Come here and be spanked for your satiable curiosity.,1
"Pooh,",1
said the Elephant’s Child.,0
I don’t think you people know anything about spanking;,1
"but I do, and I’ll show you.",1
Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.,0
O bananas!,1
"said they,",0
"where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?",1
"I got a new one from the crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River,",1
said the Elephant’s Child.,0
"I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep.",1
"It looks very ugly,",1
"said his hairy uncle, the baboon.",0
"It does,",1
said the Elephant’s Child.,0
"But it’s very useful,",1
"and he picked up his hairy uncle, the baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornet’s nest.",0
"Then that bad Elephant’s Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished.",0
He pulled out his tall ostrich aunt’s tail-feathers;,0
"and he caught his tall uncle, the giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush;",0
"and he shouted at his broad aunt, the hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals;",0
but he never let any one touch Kolokolo bird.,0
"At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the crocodile.",0
When they came back nobody spanked anybody any more;,0
"and ever since that day, O best beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see, besides all those that you won’t, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the satiable Elephant’s Child.",0
Tick Tock Turkey fans have been begging us for more tails of the time-travelling bird.,0
"In fact, they've been begging us for YEARS !",0
"We are pleased to say that Tick Tock's creator, Michael Brett has penned another story for us (with a little help from Natasha).",0
And here it is...,0
"As you may recall, Tick Tock Turkey lives on Egg Island with Future Dog and various other creatures.",0
They have been planning a huge Honolulu style festival.,0
The weather should be as perfect as it (almost) always is on Egg island.,0
It seems like all is set for a wonderful party.,0
"The float could take on board quite a few hundred people, so once it was ready all the creatures of Egg Island could hop on board.",0
"There would be an inflatable raft that would drop down to the beach on the shore edge, so all the creatures could travel to the float.",0
"The Honolulu performance festival would last two days and three nights and would take place in late July. A few hundred yards out into the sea of Egg Island, upon the Carnival float, Tick Tock Turkey was still working on the giant sign to advertise it to the Island. He was to be managing the float this year and he also had to prepare all the different drink preparations for the carnival procession in advance.",0
Coconut and Pineapple Smoothie Delight. Mango and Passion fruit Surprise. Strawberry fresh and Chocoloate swirl crush.,0
The list was endless.,0
Cocktail sticks and straws....,0
I think we need a little more elp,1
said Clive.,0
Ave you thought about getting some people to help with serving ze drinks from Egg Island?,1
Maybe ze monkeys will elp...?,1
Tick Tock Turkey turned his head sharply in dismay...,0
"Oh no, not the monkeys!",1
They’re not to be trusted!,1
We need some more sensible creatures.,1
"Well, I do know a few starfish,",1
said Clive. Tick Tock Turkey smiled:,0
"Ok, let me know!",1
"Meanwhile back on the beach, Future Dog was teaching some Yoga for poise and posture to the award-winning troupe of festival dancers.",0
"They had put together a wonderful dance of spiral, turns, leaps and shimmies but they had been practising so hard some of them were starting to complain of backache.",0
Future Dog led them into the Cat position:,0
"This isn’t my favourite,",1
"she said slowly and calmly,",0
but it will sort your back out.,1
They all let out a big sigh of relief:,0
Ahhh!!!,1
"As the evening drew on they saw the red sun setting out at sea, and Tick Tock and Clive returned from making lots of drink preparations.",0
"The Honolulu dancers, who seemed to have never stopped dancing, were swaying silently.",0
How are you?,1
"said Tick Tock to Future Dog, who was sitting under a palm tree in a meditating position whilst reading her favourite book.",0
"Oh not too bad,",1
"she said,",0
I'm just leaving the dancers to it.,1
"Yes, good idea,",1
"said Tick Tock,",0
have you considered giving them some music to dance to?,0
Future Dog looked up.,0
I’ve got a great Elvis Collection you know.,1
And it could work just the treat.,1
"Yes, that could well lighten them up.",1
Blue Moon!,1
They both nodded their heads in agreement.,0
"I’ll get my iPod and see if I can download it from Egg café,",1
said Future Dog. It will be much simpler that way.,0
See you soon!,0
What to do?,1
Ahhh yes...,1
Clive said he would ask the starfish for me to see if they could help...,1
But as he looked down the long peach-coloured beach of Egg Island he could see Clive scuttling off in the distance on his way home..,0
I’ll ask him tomorrow.,1
"The next morning, Tick Tock Turkey woke up to the sound of Blue Moon. He had fallen fast asleep through tiredness under Future Dog's Tree, and now he could make out in the haze of heat of the Island the dancers moving in a long line backwards and forwards just as he had imagined.",0
They were also making circular patterns...,0
"Ah that must be for the moon,",1
he thought.,0
I wonder if they can make the shape of an ellipse?,0
(Which is a half-shape moon.) Future Dog was waving directions at them with twinkling butterfly hands;,0
she was truly proficient at this.,0
Are you going out to the raft today?,1
she called out to Tick Tock Turkey. Tick Tock Turkey spun around:,0
Whhhhhhhhhhh oh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhh...,1
He felt a bit dizzy,0
This song is working a treat!,1
"Thanks Tick Tock,",1
"said Future Dog, smiling delightedly.",0
She had her coolest pair of shades on for the sun was beating down very heavily today and there was not a cloud in sight in the blue sky.,0
"Be sure to wear some sun-cream,",1
she said.,0
Yes yesss...,1
"And off he scuttled by the raft, just in time to see Clive with three gorgeous, golden starfish following him...",0
You're a gem!,1
he said.,0
"This is Sparky, Suki, and Sarah.",1
"said Clive, introducing the three starfish who had beautiful, big, gleaming eyes.",0
"Hello,",1
they chorused.,0
"And zey are not only good at making ze drinks, but zey can sing too!",1
"Excellent,",1
said Tick Tock.,0
Let’s get on board that raft.,1
We've got lots more preparation to carry on with before this show goes out on the road.,1
Don't you think?,1
And I need to see how the Penguins are getting on.,1
"They climbed into the little rubber dinghy and as they drew closer to the Carnival float, they could see the penguins ascending into the air like sky rockets...",0
Weeeeeeeeee!,1
"said the starfish in delight, for they had never seen anything like it.",0
How on Earth are they doing it?,1
said Tick Tock.,0
I think zey must have got ze Trampoline out.,1
At least zey are practicing...,1
But Tick Tick Tock Turkey did not like it one bit.,0
He pulled out his mega speaker cone-shaped microphone.,0
"Stop this, this instant!",1
he called out.,0
This is highly dangerous and not to be done on board the carnival float!,1
But Tick Tock pursed his lips and held his breath.,0
He wasn't too happy.,0
"Well, it looks trés impressive,",1
said Clive climbing on board the raft.,0
"said Tick Tock,",0
but I don't trust those Penguins. They are dangerous...,1
If anything happens I’ll get it in the neck.,1
"Just be careful,",1
he said as he looked out to sea.,0
"And they were all playing a little bit more safely now, splashing about in the waves.",0
"Throw them some of the arm bands,",1
he said to Clive.,0
That'll keep them safe in the waves for now.,1
"Right, starfish come with me!",1
Tick Tock Turkey led all the creatures up the raft and onto the festival boat.,0
"The performance acts were due to start at sixpm that night, and Tick Tock Turkey was getting excited.",0
Clive the Crab was busy making milkshakes and they had shown one another differences in what they had been doing.,0
All the Egg Island creatures crammed on board and were awestruck by the sight they saw.,0
The Penguin Gymnasts has formed a super triangle and were waving brightly-coloured festival flags in the air.,0
"The Penguin at the top was wobbling a bit, which amused Tick Tock Turkey, but Future Dog was scowling slightly.",0
She didn’t trust the menacing little Penguins one bit.,0
"Suddenly off they jumped and scattered left right and centre, popping off in all directions like fire crackers.",0
Luckily they still had their arm bands on and they floated when they hit the water off the boat.,0
Tick Tock Turkey turned to Future Dog:,0
Impressive!,1
he said.,0
Future Dog leaned forward:,0
Hmmm. At least they held it together.,1
"Right I’m off,",1
"said Tick Tock, looking at his watch,",0
"I've got an announcement to make for the Cocktail Buffet. Do you want me to introduce the Hawaiian Dancers, FD?",1
"Yes, that would be fab,",1
"she said, perusing the deck for her dancing troupe.",0
"Let’s just hope the people of Egg Island turn up,",1
said Tick Tock. No sooner had he spoken than a little rustling came from the trees.,0
It was like the sound of birds cheeping and they had a lot of different sounds to their voices including different types of humming and rustling.,0
Sounds like zey are coming!,1
"said Clive,",0
"quick - let’s get ze spread sheet cover on,",1
and they both made a last-minute tidy to get everything looking nice.,0
When Tick Tock Turkey ventured back to the boat he saw Future Dog handing out tickets to the locals.,0
They were all of different types and ways and had lots of different ways about them.,0
Tick Tock Turkey was eventually happy and not all together wise with the words he had seen and made.,0
It was all together a shocking sight to see and not all together very wise for him to know of.,0
Tick Tock Turkey made another slow look around:,0
"Right, I’ll make the announcement then!",1
"Future Dog smiled, everything seemed to be in order and going to plan.",0
She liked this sense of calm about the boat.,0
"Ladies and gentleman, kids and pets, it is my absolute pleasure to announce the opening of Egg Island Carnival on sea!",1
"I hope you enjoyed the Penguins. We are shortly to have cocktail buffet, where you can enjoy drinks and snacks courtesy of us and hosted by Clive.",1
Clive scuttled sideways to Tick Tock. He was waving his pincers and he shouted greetings.,0
"And then,",1
"said Tick Tock Turkey, gesturing sideways to where Future Dog was standing,",0
we will have the amazing and talented festival dancers of Honolulu to entertain you!,1
And not to mention our live band:,1
'Marvin and the Mussels'!,1
The entire crowd seemed impressed and they chattered together with what sounded like delight.,0
The whole carnival float boat seemed to buzz with excitement whilst it bobbed on the waves.,0
Marvin and the Mussels began playing.,0
"There were two guitarists and a bass player who looked like mussels with their shiny grey coats, and the lead singer Marvin, who wore shiny grey trousers, swayed back and forth with his saxophone.",0
"The festival dancers of Honolulu pranced in with their backwards and forwards Latino hip dancing, and gave a festive rhythm by clapping coconuts in their hands.",0
The crowd of Egg Island were very much enjoying themselves and one by one they moved towards the moon-shaped dance floor and started their swing dancing.,0
There were couples doing kick steps and side steps.,0
"Come on,",1
"said Future Dog to Tick Tock Turkey,",0
let’s go Swing Dancing and find a way to swing to our hearts’ content!,1
Off we go!,1
"One, two three!",1
Boing Boing!,0
"And the pair danced for glee, they were so good people made space for them on the dance floor It was nearing ten o’clock and the people of the Egg Island had been dancing for three hours.",0
The festival dancers of Honolulu were preparing for their final grand act...,0
The crowd saw them moving towards the silver stage that Clive and Tick Tock Turkey had prepared for them.,0
"Future Dog was smiling with glee, she had butterflies in her stomach as she was truly nervous for them.",0
"They made a formation and then suddenly they started dancing with their garlands, hula-hooping and spinning and twisting and swaying in patterns and shaped and diagonal formations, it appeared effortless...",0
But Future Dog knew it was hard!,0
The whole effect was kaleidoscopic and the dancers themselves were over-joyed to say the least.,0
"Meanwhile, Tick Tock Turkey was taking extra safety precautions with Clive the Crab by tying his pincers together with rubber bands so that he couldn’t accidentally burst the inflatable float, and Percy the plaice was busy making origami napkins.",0
"The band were playing their hearts out, and there was little time left before all the creatures would be together and playing in a nearby field with what they were doing.",0
"The carnival dancers were still spiralling, and the drum beats of Marvin and the Mussels who had started playing slow romantic music as the moon and stars had come out at sea over the island at sea in the blue waters.",0
All the young sweethearts of Egg Island were dancing now with glee.,0
Suddenly Future Dog felt a spatter of water on her nose.,0
"And as she looked up to the sky, and the darkening heavy grey clouds that were forming, she sensed it was going to rain.",0
"She turned to Tick Tock Turkey and said,",0
"it's going to rain, what on earth are we going to do?",1
The Carnival float boat isn't that strong!,1
"Don't be silly, FD,",1
"said Tick Tock Turkey, but not sooner had he said this when the whole sky began to crack with thunder and the rain started coming down thicker and faster.",0
"Quick, quick, for shelter!",1
"screeched Clive,",0
ze canapés!,1
Together with Percy they put a sheet over the multi-coloured drinks table.,0
We will have to come back for all of zis...,1
Tick Tock Turkey grabbed the cone-like mega phone:,0
"Attention, ladies and gentleman - we will have to take cover, there is an emergency due to a storm overhead.",1
"As a measure of caution, I urge you to take any valuables with you.",1
The people crowded to one side of the boat in panic.,0
The rain was coming down thicker now...,0
and all of a sudden a huge piece of thunder cracked the middle of the boat down the middle and the whole Island was caught in a state of mass panic.,0
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!,1
I know!,1
"said Future Dog suddenly,",0
we can find a way to see if the penguins will help bring us to shore in the emergency dinghy.,1
Quick Tick Tock - grab this rope here and tie it around the dinghy at the far end.,1
"Ok off we go, hey ho!",1
The penguins were flapping up and down and clinging on the side of the boat.,0
They were still about because they had rubber arm bands on.,0
Future Dog called out to them:,0
"You have to help us penguin, and pull the boat to shore to save Egg Island!",1
"She and Tick Tock heaved the emergency dinghy to the water, and the party people of Egg Island climbed onto the boat.",0
With their brightly-coloured clothes and shoes they looked like a mass of piranhas as they neared the water.,0
"Meanwhile Marvin and the Mussels were still playing, though their music was getting sadder and more tragic sounding.",0
Clive and Percy were still anticipating the worst and they were hiding under the giant telescope;,0
they couldn't bear to leave the festival carnival float boat.,0
What else could they do?,0
It was of no and little use whatsoever to them...,0
That much was for certain...,0
They could tell.,0
"All the people of Egg Island climbed into the boat down a ladder from the side, relieved to be saved from the storm, and rain still pouring down.",0
Suddenly forty penguins appeared and placed the rope coming from the emergency boat around their tiny little waists.,0
"As they swam, the little boat with all ten persons from Egg Island was safely pulled back across the choppy waves to the shore.",0
"Luckily, it was not that far.",0
Tick Tock Turkey and Future Dog sat on the edge of the boat.,0
They could hear the band still playing.,0
They're mad!,1
"exclaimed Tick Tock. The dancers, who were also good swimmers, had a little raft of their own.",0
They could see them rowing back to shore in their little rubber dinghy.,0
Suddenly both friends turned to one another:,0
What about Clive and Percy?,0
Where were they?,0
They couldn't see them on the boat.,0
They both looked sharply back at back at the sinking carnival float in the distance...,0
"Meanwhile, back on the float:",0
Clive and Percy were sending an SOS signal out to the sky!,0
In tiny little blow-off rockets.,0
"They were in a state of panic, still unable to face leaving the boat.",0
"What else could they do, but wait and wait and see?",0
What would happen?!,0
"We are going to perish,",1
"said Percy, who seemed to have forgotten his old sea life under the waves (he had been on Egg Island so long).",0
Percy suddenly had a second will to survive;,0
"he turned to Clive and said,",0
Let us pop the float and we can travel back in two little round rubber rings...,1
I know there is one left!,1
"Together they hopped into the round rubber dinghy and before they rowed off, Clive called to the musicians,",0
Quick!,1
"Jump now, for your lives, mes amis!",1
Ze festival float is going down!,1
"And as he said this, he pinched a hole in the side of the float to let all the air out of it.",0
"After this, the float began sinking rapidly and they could see Marvin and the Mussels sailing off in rubber dinghies.",0
Where did they get those from?,1
said Percy to Clive. But Clive had buried his head in his pincers.,0
He was too sad to speak at the loss of the Carnival float he had personally inflated.,0
When the fish and the crab reached the shore of Egg Island they were greeted by Tick Tock and Future Dog.,0
You’re alive!,1
they both said.,0
They were overjoyed to see them.,0
But Clive looked so sad.,0
He turned to Tick Tock and said,0
Ze Carnival Float and ze Party festival of Honolulu ruined forever!,1
"Oh Clive,",1
said Tick Tock sympathetically.,0
"Listen, there still might be a chance to keep the party alive,",1
said Future Dog as she looked up to the sky.,0
It was beginning to clear.,0
In the early morning light...,1
we could do a festival party finale...,1
what say you Tick Tock?,1
"Well yes, but we'd have to make it extra special..",1
and to cheer Clive up...,1
something to brew up the milkshakes!,1
"Well, you haven't used your Time Travelling watch yet, have you Tick Tock?",1
intimated Future Dog.,0
Oh yes!,1
How could I have forgotten?,1
"said Tick Tock, as he looked at his red time-travelling wrist watch.",0
I'm going to go back in time and get something truly magical for the festival finale!,1
"Great,",1
said Future Dog as she rushed off to get the festival dancers.,0
When she turned around Tick Tock Turkey was gone.,0
She looked up to the sky and saw a streak of purple and white...,0
Wherever has he gone to I wonder...?,1
But it was pointless thinking about it.,0
Instead she thought she would help to see if Marvin and the Mussels would resurrect their playing and organise a little salsa class to keep the revived partygoers of Egg Island entertained until Tick Tock Turkey would come back with his magic ingredient.,0
The Festival dancers of Honolulu were busy doing splits and handstands and moving about the beach....,0
"Clive and Percy the Crab were busy with hats and pieces of string all set to different tunes and styles, they could little help themselves now, it seemed.",0
"Future Dog thought she had better practise her Yoga for the day, Tick Tock Turkey would be back any second now.",0
No sooner had she thought this than Tick Tock Turkey landed right next to her with a thump.,0
"He had in his hand a very funny-looking bird, and in his some cocktail sticks!",0
All the way from Hawaii!,1
he squawked.,0
"What think you, Future Dog?",1
"I think Clive and Percy will be delighted to see it,",1
she remarked back.,0
"When you see them you can tell them all about it,",1
"said Future Dog, who was in a funny swan-like position.",0
"OK, see you later!",1
"said Tick Tock Turkey to Future Dog. Half an hour later, Future Dog found Tick Tock Turkey with a very happy Clive and Little Percy with a magical drinks and buffet table decorated with Tick Tock Turkey's little sparkling glitter cocktail sticks from one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys Honolulu. Suddenly some other dancers she had not seen before appeared and they had little red jackets on and peddle-pusher blue jeans.",0
"And these are original dancers from the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys!",1
"said Tick Tock,",0
I thought I would keep them for you as a surprise.,1
They really know how to rock ’n’ roll!,1
"Yum yumm,",1
"he said, tasting one,",0
these are amazing!,1
Here's to the finale of Honolulu on Egg Island !,1
"Tick Tock, bye bye!",1
"And needless to say the whole of Egg Island danced all night long and through the next day, until it was vibrating and moved the waves of its surrounding waters, impressing the nearby Islands.",0
"The word ""gest"" is old English, and a bit of a pun.",0
"It could mean a ""jest"" or a ""guest"" and it has an ancient meaning as a ""heroic deed"".",0
"Normally Robin likes to entertain his guests in Sherwood Forest with food and wine, before relieving them of their gold.",0
But in this story his guest is a sad Knight who has no money to surrender.,0
"Instead, Robin lends him money so that he can repay a loan to the cruel Abbot. As in all Robin Hood stories, anybody in authority is a baddie (except King Richard) - and that includes the leaders of the church who are abusing their power.",0
More episodes will follow.,0
"The Guest of Robin Hood Of all the thieves and highway robbers who have ever lived, by far the politest was Robin Hood. He liked to entertain those he robbed as guests in his own home.",0
"Although his home was a rough camp in Greenwood, which was in the thickest and darkest part of Sherwood forest.",0
His table was always heavy with rich food and wine.,0
He was very choosy about those whom he invited to his lair.,0
He only liked to rob the best sort of people;,0
"nobles, knights, barons, and leading figures of the church.",0
He treated his victims with such great courtesy and hospitality that afterwards some of them said that it had been a privilege to have been robbed by Robin Hood. One day Robin and his men had been out shooting game in the King’s forest.,0
"It was this habit that had made them outlaws in the first place – for the King’s brother, John, had declared that all the forests belonged to him – and anyone who hunted there without his permission would face severe punishment.",0
"King Richard himself would not have deprived the foresters of food, but he was away fighting wars overseas.",0
"While he was away, his brother John ruled England with cruelty and injustice.",0
"On this day the hunting had been good, and Robin Hood and his men were looking forward to a fine dinner.",0
"But let us not be greedy and keep all this fine food for ourselves,",1
said Robin.,0
I will not eat until I have a worthy guest at my table.,1
"Little John, go and find me a fitting guest and invite him to dine with us.",1
"Little John’s real name was John Little, but everyone called him Little John because he was so huge.",0
He was six foot five inches tall and as broad as a tree.,0
"He was Robin’s most trusted partner in crime, and feared nothing and nobody – not even Robin. Although he was hungry, he agreed to go and find a guest.",0
He took two of the best men – Will Scarlet and Much the miller’s son.,0
They went up to the highway to wait for a suitable guest to come along.,0
The road was quiet and they waited an hour or more for a suitable victim.,0
At last a knight came riding down the road.,0
"As he drew near they saw that he was lost in thought, and there was a look of great sadness on his face.",0
The three men jumped out and pointed their arrows at his chest.,0
Their long bows were so powerful that they could easily pass through any armoured breast plate or chain mail.,0
"Cheer up gentle Sir Knight,",1
called out Little John.,0
You are invited to the table of my master for dinner tonight.,1
"The knight was startled and replied,",0
"But I plan to dine in Barnslydale tonight, for tomorrow I must go to see the Abbot on urgent business.",1
"Tis a pity,",1
"said Little John, still aiming his arrow at the knight’s chest,",0
For my master will take great offence should you refuse his kind invitation.,1
And who might your master be?,1
asked the knight.,0
"His name should be known to all who pass by Sherwood Forest, for it is Robin Hood.",1
"In that case I shall come,",1
"said the knight,",0
For I have heard much about him.,1
"Will Scarlet placed a blindfold over the knight’s eyes, and they led him through the forest to the hideaway.",0
Robin greeted the knight with great courtesy;,0
"Welcome to Greenwood gentle Sir Knight, all ours is yours.",1
"They washed their hands together in the stream, and then they dined on pheasant, trout, cuts of venison, and barley bread, then swilled it down with plenty of red wine.",0
"I have not eaten such a dinner in these last three months,",1
"declared the knight,",0
"and if you visit my castle, I shall make you a fine feast in return.",1
"said Robin,",0
"I would much prefer, kind sir, that you paid before you leave – for it is the custom in Greenwood that a peasant’s son such as I should not pay for a knight.",1
The sad expression returned to the knight’s face.,0
"I have but ten shillings,",1
he said.,0
Robin had not entertained such a poor guest at his table before.,0
"If what you say is true,",1
"he said,",0
I will not take one penny off you.,1
"Indeed, I shall lend you money from my own coffers.",1
Robin sent Little John to look through the Knight’s belongings.,0
"When he had checked them he said,",0
Our gentle knight is indeed a pauper.,1
How come so poor?,1
Asked Robin. The sad knight told his story:,0
"He had a son who was a fine, strong, but hot-tempered young man.",0
"He liked to joust, and in a contest he had killed the son of a baron.",0
"The baron demanded blood money of four hundred pounds, and if it was not paid, the knight’s son would be put on trial for murder and executed.",0
"In those days, four hundred pounds was a great deal of money, and although the knight had a steady income from his lands, he did not have such a sum ready to give.",0
"He was forced to borrow from a wealthy churchman, the Abbot of the Monastery of St. Mary. The Abbot gave the knight just three months to repay the loan, and if he failed to pay back the money in that time, the knight must give the Abbot all his land instead.",0
"The time of the loan was almost up, and the Knight was travelling to the Abbot to plead for more time to pay,",0
"But the Abbot did not become rich by showing mercy,",1
"said the knight,",0
and therefore I fully expect that by tomorrow evening I will truly be a landless pauper.,1
I plan to take a ship and join King Richard who is fighting in the Holy Lands.,1
"""Too many good knights are overseas,"" said Robin, ""which is why there is so much injustice at home.",0
"No, by St. Mary who is dear to me, I shall make you a loan of four hundred pounds and you shall repay the Abbot."" The next day at the Monastery of St. Mary, a monk spoke to the Abbot:",0
Your Worshipful Grace...,1
Today the knight must repay his loan or forfeit his lands.,1
"He will surely forfeit,",1
"replied the Abbot,",0
for I do not think he will find four hundred pounds in so short a time.,1
"When the knight and Little John arrived outside the Monastery, they changed into their poor clothes again, before entering and asking to see the Abbot. The porter at the gate said,",0
That surely is the shabbiest and saddest looking Knight that I ever did see.,1
"Inside the main hall, the knight knelt down before Abbot. The Abbot did not greet him, but said straight out,",0
"Well, have you brought my money?",1
"Not one penny,",1
replied the knight.,0
"The monk said, ""Then why did you come to waste His Grace’s time like this?",0
Your lands are lost.,0
"Go away.""",0
"I came,",1
"said the knight,",0
to ask for mercy and more time to pay.,1
"You shall not have a minute more,",1
said the Abbot.,0
Your lands are mine.,1
Be off.,1
"If you give me more time, I shall serve you faithfully,",1
said the knight.,0
"Show mercy, for it is good to help one who has need.",1
At this the Abbot swore a great oath and roundly cursed him.,0
Out false knight!,1
Speed out of my hall!,1
he shouted.,0
"I am no false knight,",1
replied the debtor.,0
With that he opened his bag and emptied the gold onto the floor.,0
"If you had shown mercy, I would have repaid your debt and served you faithfully, but as it is, here is your money.",1
"Now the papers to my land, Your Grace, if you please.",1
"The Abbot had no choice but to hand back the deeds to the knight’s land – although he was sorry to do so, for it was worth a good deal more than four hundred pounds in gold.",0
"Two day’s later, the knight returned to his castle wearing his sad expression.",0
Are we paupers?,1
Asked his wife.,0
"said he, brightening up, ""we are saved.",0
God bless Robin Hood!,0
The man that harms the victor of this match will have to contend with me!,1
"The nobleman’s friends did not want to take on a knight, and they released the peasant.",0
"Follow me,",1
"said the knight,",0
and I will take you to join Robin Hood and his men.,1
"The peasant agreed, for he knew that if he did not, the noblemen would get him later.",0
"The knight arrived late for his meeting with Robin, and when he explained what had delayed him on the way, Robin said,",0
"Gentle Sir Knight, consider the four hundred pounds a gift, for I will not accept a penny from a man who stands up for justice.",1
"Then take these,",1
"said the knight, and he showed Robin the one hundred arrows plumbed with peacock feathers.",0
"That evening the gentle knight was a guest at Robin’s table for a second time, and they feasted until they could eat no more.",0
"The first time we met Jeremy and Jemima’s wicked Uncle Jeff, we discovered that he was not so much",0
wicked,1
irresponsible.,1
Mum and Dad decided that it would be better if he did not look after the children again.,0
"But when Dad forgot to book a holiday, the family went to stay with Uncle Jeff in his house by the sea.",0
A little oversight by Jeff led to the children getting into heaps of trouble – and their uncle getting into even more.,0
Story by Bertie Read by Natasha. Duration twenty-one.forty-six.,0
It was summer.,0
Everyone was going away on holiday.,0
"Everyone, that is, except for Jeremy, Jemima and their parents.",0
"You see, Dad hadn’t booked a trip this year because he couldn’t decide where to go.",0
Europe was so expensive.,0
America was so far away.,0
India was so hot.,0
Oh dear.,0
He couldn’t think of the perfect place that would be just right.,0
School had already broken up for the long vacation.,0
The kids were growing bored.,0
Mum was becoming irritable.,0
And Dad was still studying the travel pages of the newspapers.,0
"Well there’s always England,",1
Mum said one Sunday morning in July.,0
England....,1
repeated Dad ...,0
"as though he had never heard of the place, although he had lived there all his life.",0
And then he added:,0
Doesn’t it always rain in England?,1
At this Mum lost her patience:,0
Well look out of the window.,1
Does it seem like it’s raining to you?,1
she snapped.,0
"Because you see, it had been hot and sunny every day for a month.",0
And Jeremy pleaded:,0
Dad we must go on holiday.,1
We can’t stay in this dump all summer long.,1
And Jemima began to sing:,0
I do love to be beside the seaside.,1
I do love to be beside the sea.,1
"Dad shook his head and muttered that it was probably too late to go on holiday to the English seaside, because everywhere would be booked up by now.",0
But Jeremy had an idea.,0
I know.,1
Uncle Jeff’s got a holiday house by the sea.,1
Let’s go and stay with Uncle Jeff. Can we please?,1
Oh NO!,1
said Mum.,0
Not with Uncle Jeff.,1
And the thought of staying with his brother was enough to make Dad go upstairs to his study and scour the internet for holiday cottages by the sea.,0
Unfortunately he was right.,0
It was too late.,0
Everything was booked up.,0
"On the first of August, the tyres of Dad’s big blue estate car crunched up the driveway of Uncle Jeff’s country house by the sea.",0
said Jeremy.,0
This isn’t a house.,1
It’s a castle!,1
"Don’t be silly, Jeremy,",1
said Jemima.,0
"In the old days big houses had turrets to look nice, not because they were real castles.",1
"And although Uncle Jeff’s house wasn’t quite a castle, it was certainly large.",0
His sports car was parked in front of the house.,0
He kept a boat on a trailer in the garage and he had a few sheep to nibble the grass on the lawn.,0
"If you went round the back of the house, you could see the sea.",0
"And a rather noisy family of sea gulls was living in the turret that had so impressed Jeremy. As the family clambered out of the car, Jeremy asked :",0
Dad why is Uncle Jeff so much richer than you?,0
And Dad looked cross and muttered something about ill-gotten gains.,0
"And by then, the ",0
Wicked Uncle,1
himself was standing on the steps leading up to the front door and calling out:,0
Hello Gang!,1
The kids both waved and called back,0
Hello Uncle Jeff!,1
but Dad couldn’t have looked more annoyed if a sea gull had just pooped on his head.,0
Uncle Jeff’s housekeeper showed the family to their rooms and then they all came down to the dining room for tea and scones.,0
Mum asked:,0
"Well kids, what do you want do this holiday?",1
and Jeremy and Jemima chorused,0
Go to the beach!,1
But Dad looked a bit fed up because he thought the beach was boring.,0
"I’ll tell you what,",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
I’ll take the kids to the beach so that Mum and Dad can have some time together.,1
They can take a lovely walk along the cliffs to the next village where there’s a great old pub.,1
"And although Dad thought that the walk along the cliffs to the old pub did sound rather nice, he said:",0
It’s alright Jeff. We’ll look after the kids.,1
Jeremy and Jemima loved everything to do with the beach.,0
"Digging sandcastles, eating ice cream, playing volleyball, diving into the waves, and snoozing in the sun.",0
"Mum and Dad both wore big floppy hats, put on sun cream, and read big fat paper back books.",0
In the evenings they went into town and walked along the waterfront where they bought fish and chips.,0
The town was an old port built on the mouth of a wide river leading out to sea.,0
"There was always something interesting to look at, as the water was always busy with yachts and fishing boats, and the car ferry sailing to and fro.",0
On Thursday evening there was something rather different to look at.,0
A sleek white yacht the size of a ship had pulled into port.,0
It was so big that it made the other yachts look like toys.,0
"Everyone was impressed, and none less than Jeremy.",0
"I bet its owner is even richer than Uncle Jeff,",1
he said.,0
"Yes, I wonder who owns it,",1
"said Mum. And later that evening, when they asked Uncle Jeff about the yacht, he promised to speak to his friend who knew all the gossip about the port.",0
"The routine of beach during the day and stroll during the evening continued, but when Dad had read to the end of his book, he began to think how nice it would be to take that walk along the cliffs to the pub.",0
"And when he mentioned the idea to Mum, even she said:",0
Yes it would be nice to have a break from the kids.,1
Dad pondered:,0
I don’t suppose they could come to any harm on the beach with Uncle Jeff.,1
And Mum agreed:,0
No I don’t suppose they could.,1
The next day they gave Uncle Jeff his instructions for looking after the kids.,0
They must wear hats and sun lotion.,0
They mustn’t swim too far out to sea.,0
They mustn’t have more than one ice cream each.,0
They mustn’t shriek and make too much noise.,0
And Jeff said:,0
Right-oh.,1
Got ya.,1
Which didn’t make Mum feel at all reassured.,0
But Uncle Jeff did make sure that the kids wore hats and sun lotion.,0
And he only them bought two ice creams each.,0
"And for a while, he did watch them while they were swimming.",0
"He even bought them a little inflatable boat, so that they could have some fun floating on it and jumping on and off into the waves.",0
But the thing that made the day more interesting than other days on the beach was that the Russian yacht had moved.,0
It was sitting anchored out at sea not that far away from the beach.,0
"When a helicopter took off from the deck, Jeff took out his binoculars and let Jeremy look through them.",0
Wow that’s amazing,1
said Jeremy. Uncle Jeff said that the owner of the ship was called Sergei Manovich and that he was one of the richest men in Russia – in fact he was richer than some countries.,0
"Wow he must be really wicked,",1
said Jeremy. And Uncle Jeff agreed that he probably was.,0
"Uncle Jeff watched the kids play all morning, but in the afternoon he decided that it would probably be alright if he allowed himself a short nap.",0
"After all, they are good kids really,",1
he said to himself.,0
And they can’t come to much harm on the beach.,1
Jeremy and Jemima were playing ‘Pirates’ with the little boat.,0
"At first they didn’t go more than a few yards from the beach, but gradually the waves and their game took them a little further out.",0
"They were still among the swimmers and the wind surfers, but Jemima said:",0
"Jeremy, I think we ought to go back in,",1
and they both leant over the boat and started to paddle with their hands.,0
"But instead of returning to the beach, the current pulled them further out.",0
First Jemima and then Jeremy started to wave and call out,0
Uncle Jeff!,1
Uncle Jeff!,1
but he was fast asleep and didn’t see or hear them.,0
Soon they were really quite a long way out.,0
Oh no.,1
"I think we are in trouble,",1
said Jemima. And even Jeremy felt frightened.,0
They were so far out now that they were closer to the Russian ship than the shore.,0
Jemima could see a sailor on the deck as he leant against the side and watched the beach.,0
She waved frantically to him and called,0
Help Help,1
and after a while the sailor waved back.,0
He thinks you’re just saying hello,1
"said Jeremy. But fortunately the sailor was smarter than that, because very soon after, the yacht started to lower a life raft down the side.",0
Thank goodness we’re saved,1
"said Jemima. But when Jeremy and Jemima stood up in their little boat, it tipped over and both of them fell into the sea.",0
A sailor dived off the life raft and swam over to help them.,0
"It was a bit of a struggle, but both children were hauled spluttering and shaking up onto the raft.",0
One of the sailors said in a foreign accent:,0
Well kids.,1
"Would you like a ride back to the beach, or would you like to see on board our ship first?",1
Jemima said:,0
Back to the beach please.,1
But Jeremy said:,0
Oh can we see the ship?,1
Please please can we see the ship?,1
"Back on the beach, Uncle Jeff sat up slowly and scanned the shore for a sight of the children.",0
"He couldn’t see them anywhere, but he said to himself:",0
I expect they’ve gone to buy another ice cream.,1
Then he rummaged in his bag and took out his binoculars to have another look at the Russian yacht.,0
He noticed a life boat being winched up the side.,0
He focused in closer and saw two small children in the boat.,0
"Funny. They look a bit like Jeremy and Jemima,",1
he said to himself.,0
And then he noticed their little dingy capsized near by.,0
They are Jeremy and Jemima,1
he said.,0
Oh no.,1
I’m going to be in a heap of trouble for this.,1
And he ran down to the sea and started to swim out towards the yacht as fast as he could.,0
"He was a powerful swimmer, and he soon reached the yacht.",0
He started to climb up the anchor chain.,0
"This was no easy thing to do, but Jeff was no ordinary uncle.",0
"On board the ship, two young ladies wearing sun glasses, hats, and bikinis took charge of Jeremy and Jemima. They showed them the swimming pool, the gymnasium, the beauty salon, the cinema, and the helicopter pad.",0
"It’s like a floating palace,",1
"said Jeremy. And one of the women said,",0
"Yes, it is exactly like a palace.",1
Excuse me.,1
Are you Russian?,1
asked Jemima. The lady whose name was Chiara laughed and said,0
"No. I am from Italy and my friend Julia is from Brazil, but the owner is Russian and the crew are from Ukraine.",1
"And at about that same time, at the other end of the ship, two Ukrainian sailors were amazed to find Uncle Jeff clambering on board from the top of the anchor chain.",0
"Hi. I’m looking for my niece and nephew,",1
"said Uncle Jeff, as he jumped onto the deck.",0
But the sailors did not understand him.,0
"Instead, they tried to grab hold of him.",0
"Oi. That’s not a nice welcome,",1
said Uncle Jeff and threw a punch at one of the sailors.,0
This was a rather silly thing to do.,0
The second sailor hit him over the head with something heavy and Uncle Jeff fell unconscious on the deck.,0
The sailors dragged him down into the hold and locked him inside a sea container.,0
Jeremy and Jemima were sitting by the swimming pool and sipping milk shakes.,0
"I think we should go back to the beach now if you don’t mind,",1
said Jemima.,0
Our Uncle Jeff will be worried about us.,1
"And Chiara said,",0
"Yes I will go and ask the sailors who rescued you,",1
and she went off to look for them.,0
"Up in the bridge of the ship, the two sailors who had found Uncle Jeff reported to the captain.",0
"So we have a British spy,",1
said the captain.,0
We shall put him out to sea and get rid of him before the boss gets back.,1
"Soon after that, Jeremy and Jemima noticed that the ship was starting to move.",0
Jemima ran up to a sailor and said,0
You can’t go out to sea.,1
You’ve got to take us back to the beach first.,1
"But the sailor didn’t understand what she was saying, and besides, he was busy.",0
"Jeremy ran off to look for Chiara and Julia, but he couldn’t find them anywhere.",0
Eventually he bumped into Jemima who was also looking for help.,0
"Oh no,",1
she said.,0
I think we’ve been kidnapped.,0
"Perhaps they are going to take us to Russia,",1
Jeremy said sadly.,0
But the ship did not go very far out to sea before it stopped and weighed anchor again.,0
A group of sailors gathered on the deck and two of them held a long piece of wood.,0
They started to tie it to the railing so that it stuck out over the edge of the boat.,0
It was a bridge to nowhere.,0
"When Jeremy saw this, he grew very frightened.",0
Do you know what?,1
he said.,0
They are pirates.,1
And I think they are going to make us walk the plank.,1
"Don’t be so silly,",1
said Jemima.,0
Why would they want do do that?,1
"But Jeremy whispered,",0
Hide!,1
and both of them slipped inside the door to the beauty salon.,0
Ten minutes later Jeremy cautiously looked out of the porthole to see what was going on.,0
He saw that two sailors were gripping a man by his arms.,0
His hands were tied behind his back.,0
They were dragging him towards the plank.,0
"Jemima. Come and see this,",1
said Jeremy.,0
They’ve got a prisoner and they are going to make him walk the plank.,1
"Oh stop being stupid,",1
"said Jemima, but she was curious enough to come and take a look through the porthole.",0
Oh my goodness me!,1
she said.,0
That’s Uncle Jeff!,1
And both the children rushed out onto the deck.,0
Stop!,1
Stop!,1
cried Jemima. And Jeremy ran up to Uncle Jeff and threw his arms out to hug his legs.,0
"Kids, am I glad to see you!",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
You won’t believe this.,1
These guys were about to make me walk the plank.,1
The sailors seemed confused and one of them went to talk to the captain.,0
"A little later the helicopter landed on the ship and, Sergei Manovich, the Russian owner, climbed out, bowing his head under the rotor blades.",0
Chiara and Julia were up on the helipad to meet him with kisses and hugs.,0
"They pointed to Jeff and the children, and he gave them a friendly wave.",0
"A little later, the children were splashing in the pool.",0
Uncle Jeff was chatting to Sergei while Julia and Chiara sunned themselves.,0
"Towards evening, a life boat took the visitors back to the shore.",0
"As they drove back to the house, Uncle Jeff said:",0
"I don’t think we need to tell Mum and Dad about this little adventure, do you?",1
And Jemima said:,0
No. And we won’t tell them that you bought us two ice creams either.,1
Gladys has been invited out to dinner with Darren Wolf the dishy vampire actor.,0
"Her friends are excited for her, and she is nervous.",0
Will he be angry when she tells him she is not interested in romance?,0
"Gladys goes it Alone, Chapter ten:",0
"First Date By eleven the next morning, Gladys had a message on her phone from a dishy voice that loads of girls would have gladly suffered a Transylvanian bite of death for.",0
"Darren Woolf was inviting her to Rubies, a club in Mayfair where all the celebrities and the posh socialites with titles like,",0
The Honourable,1
hang out.,0
"Some of the people on the dance floor are in line for the Throne. ""I would be a fool to turn him down,"" she thought, ""but I vow to myself that I'll be careful.",0
I will be up front about not wanting to take it any further.,0
"Even if he hates me for it, it doesn't matter.",0
I've not lost anything.,0
"tap water"" but didn't.",0
"The barman asked her, ""Still or sparkling Madam?"" ",0
"Still,",1
she said.,0
"""You know, there's something I probably ought to tell you,"" Gladys admitted, dipping her eyelids down shyly, and then looking up at him and appealing for sympathy.",0
"""I'm only sixteen and this is my first date.",0
"Oh no, I didn't mean it quite like that.",0
What I meant was;,0
I've never been out with anyone.,0
"I mean, rather I didn't mean to say that this is a date, but rather that it isn't, if you understand.",0
I'll just stick with conversation.,1
"I wanted to say how much I like your music, and discuss if I can help your career.",1
"In any case,",1
"added Gladys who had been reading the celebrity blogs,",0
You’ve got a girlfriend.,1
"""Well not anymore, actually, but more to the point, have you still got that terrible agent?",0
"Hey Gladdy, you’re famous.",1
What do you mean?,1
Gladys replied.,0
Seen the Daily Post online?,1
Your pics in the sidebar with all the celebs.,1
What had she done to deserve inclusion in the ‘Sidebar of Shame’ where the online newspaper dumped all the celebrity tittle-tattle that made it so popular?,0
"To her amazement, and some horror, it was true.",0
"She could hardly believe her eyes - not one, but three pictures of her, coming out of Rubies holding onto Darren’s arm, walking across the pavement, and then getting into the back of the Limo. At one point Darren was holding her hand...",0
but it had not been like that.,0
He was just helping her.,0
How did they snap those?,1
She thought.,0
"At the time, she had hardly noticed the photographers - she assumed they were interested in Darren, not her, because, well, she wasn’t famous yet.",0
She took a deep breath and scanned the article.,0
Who is that young chick on Darren’s arm?,0
Chick!,1
What a cheek!,1
Thought Gladys. She had somehow managed to forget that her family’s fame rested on a band called the chiX).,0
"Darren Wolf was spotted stepping out with sixteen-year-old Gladys Jones, the younger sister of girl band, the chiX, which broke up last year.",0
"Gladys, who was too young to join her song-sisters in their heyday, has now quit school to pursue her own musical career.",0
"A friend of Darren Wolf told the Post,",0
"There’s nothing romantic between them, they’re just close friends.",1
Darren wants to see if he can help Gladys professionally.,1
He really respects her as an artist.,1
"I think he likes her a lot, but she is a tad on the young side for him.",1
"Other diners at Mayfair’s Rubies club reported that the Bitten star seemed smitten by his pretty, young companion as they were dancing up close later on.",0
The news that Darren’s old flame super-model Michelle De La Mare is seeing boxing champ Hussein Akwal has set tongues wagging about who will be the vampire actor’s next victim of love.,0
Watch this hot couple for further developments.,0
Gladys’ first bite of fame actually quite annoyed her.,0
"It’s all wrong,",1
she thought.,0
I’m not seeing Darren;,1
I just went out with him once.,1
"Besides, I don’t want to be known as Darren’s girlfriend, I want to be me, just me in my own right;",1
"an artist, not a chick.",1
"In any case,",1
"she wondered,",0
how did they know my name?,1
She realised there were two possibilities:,0
"either the club had tipped off the press, or Darren had told them.",0
Why would he drop her in it?,0
She dialled his number.,0
"Hi Darren,",1
"she said,",0
"It’s me, Gladys. Have you seen the Daily Post?",1
"Yes, I’m just looking at it now.",1
"Nice pics of you,",1
he said.,0
You have two great advantages.,1
You are young and you don’t drink.,1
You looked fresh at twoam.,1
Even the top models look pretty iffy when they come stumbling out of Rubies.,1
Was it really twoam?,1
"She asked, horrified that she had been out so late.",0
"Something like that,",1
he said.,0
But don’t worry - it makes it perfectly clear there is nothing going on between us.,1
I insisted on that.,1
You mean you spoke to them?,1
"Asked Gladys, quite taken aback.",0
"Not me, but my agent did.",1
He is very much interested in you by the way.,1
His colleague in the music department is keen to get you on their books.,1
They thought a little publicity wouldn’t do you any harm.,1
"But nobody asked me,",1
protested Gladys.,0
"The press don’t ask permission,",1
said Darren.,0
It’s a free country.,1
Sometimes they write things you do not like.,1
"Sometimes they get it a bit wrong, but if you are going to make it in the world of entertainment, you have to cut a few compromises.",1
"If a journalist calls, get back to them right away, or get your PR to get back to them, because journos are always on tight deadlines.",1
Be polite to these people.,1
"Give them what they need, but on your terms.",1
"If you do not help them, they will write something anyway, and they might twist the knife.",1
These are the rules you have to learn.,1
Take it from me.,1
"When you are newsworthy, your career starts to become a whole lot easier.",1
People call you.,1
Things start to happen.,1
But what if they write too much about you?,1
Asked Gladys.,0
Shouldn’t you keep the press at arm’s length?,1
"Hey Gladdy, when you’re Beyoncé, you can worry about that.",1
"Right now, you need to get your name known.",1
Gladys began to see it is a big advantage if people know your name.,0
"When she had walked into the record company, they had been so patronising.",0
They thought she was a sixteen-year-old nobody.,0
It wasn’t her music they were interested in.,0
What did some smooth geezer in a suit care about her art?,0
It was her value as a commodity.,0
They valued her price as next to zero.,0
They wanted someone they could package up and sell to the public.,0
"If the public had seen your picture, and thought you were the girlfriend of the star in a vampire movie...",0
well you had done half the work for them - your price tag had gone up a few notches.,0
It wasn’t so hard to imagine your name on the bottom of a recording contract.,0
People did start to get in touch with her.,0
The first was Laura - that evening she received a rare message from her starlet sister who resided in California.,0
"Hey Glad, just drooling over the pics of that vampire boy you’re stepping out with.",1
Lucky little sister me thinks.,1
"Gladys replied,",0
"He’s a nice guy, but I’m not stepping out with him, and I’m not planning to.",1
He wants to help me with my career.,1
"Then Laura messaged,",0
Still same old Miss Sensible-Pants. Well get your bum on a flight over here and meet my record label.,1
They want to snap you up before anyone else grabs you.,1
thought Gladys.,0
What a change!,1
"Just one silly article in the papers, and suddenly my sister wants to help me.",1
Well Carpe Diem!,1
She wrote it down absent-mindedly on her notepad.,0
"If she had stayed on at school, she would have taken Latin as one of her A-levels.",0
"It meant,",0
"reap the day,",1
seize the moment.,1
How was she going to afford a flight to California?,0
She had spent almost all her savings on recordings.,0
How was she going to seize the moment without any money?,0
The situation was such a ...,0
"she nearly said a bad word aloud, but she was too nice to do that, even in the solitude of her own room.",0
"Instead, she picked up her teddy bear by the ear and threw him across against the wall.",0
"He was sixteen years old, like Gladys, and a bit too doddery for rough play.",0
She couldn’t sleep that night.,0
She had a sort of waking dream.,0
"She was thinking of a flight taking off for LA, and could see a passenger seat occupied by a ghost girl.",0
"She couldn’t fasten the seat belt around her tummy, because it wasn’t substantial.",0
She couldn’t even taste the rubbery airline chicken.,0
Then she was looking out of the window.,0
"She could see the palm trees on the beach, the cool dudes surfing the waves.",0
"She imagined the sleek offices of the music company - and there she was - not actually her, but the ghost of the girl who might have been a star.",0
Her first break and she couldn’t take it.,0
She knew how changeable and unreliable Laura was.,0
"If she didn’t get on a flight right away, her sister would forget all about what she had said.",0
Next week could be too late.,0
"How was she going to beg, steal or borrow the price of an airline ticket?",0
"She might have to ask her management company, but they had been so rubbish at managing her, she did not want to get into their debt.",0
Oh fiddle sticks!,0
You never know what is around the corner though.,0
"Sometimes the planets do all line up and pay you favours, because the next day she received some more good news.",0
Do you remember her dustbin song?,0
She had actually forgotten all about it.,0
"It was hardly her most profound composition, but she had sent it into a competition run by the local council.",0
"The prize for the winning entry, which would be used to thank people who kept London tidy by dropping their litter in a bin, was £two thousand.",0
Guess what?,0
Gladdy won it!,0
It now meant that she was on her way to California to do business with the entertainment industry.,0

Proofread by Claire Deakin & Jana Elizabeth. One day the eldest son wanted to go to the forest to cut wood.,0
"The mother praised him for being such a useful boy, and before he set out she gave him some of her best fruit cake for his lunch, and a bottle of wine to wash it down.",0
"While the boy was walking through the forest, he met a little grey old man who said to him:",0
Do give me a little piece of your cake and a swig of your wine.,1
I’m so terribly hungry and thirsty.,1
And the eldest son replied:,0
"Be off with you, you filthy old beggar.",1
"The little grey old man went away, but not without taking his revenge.",0
"He put a curse on the boy, so that when he started to cut a tree down, his axe slipped and went into his leg.",0
The boy limped home to his mother who washed his wound and bandaged him.,0
"The next day, the second eldest son went out to the forest to cut wood.",0
"Before he set out, his mother praised him for being such a useful boy, but especially asked him to be careful with the axe, so as not to have a nasty accident like his brother.",0
"The boy promised not to be careless, and his mother gave him some of her best sponge cake for his lunch, and a bottle of wine to wash it down.",0
"It happened that as the boy was walking through the woods, he came across the same little grey old man.",0
The man said to him:,0
"Do please share your sponge cake and your wine with me, for I am so terribly weak with hunger and thirst.",1
The boy said:,0
"Be off with you, you lazy old scoundrel.",1
"If you want to eat, you’d better work.",1
"The little grey old man went away, but not without taking his revenge.",0
"Not long after, when the boy was cutting down a tree, his axe flew out of his hand and hit him on the head.",0
He crawled home to his mother who bandaged up his wound and asked him why he had not kept his promise to be more careful.,0
"For the rest of the week, the two eldest sons were both lying in bed recovering from their wounds.",0
The father said to the third and youngest son:,0
"Get on your feet, you lazy Dummy. Why are you sitting around doing nothing, when both brothers are hurt and unable to work?",1
Get out to the forest and cut some wood – if you’re not too stupid to do that.,1
The mother laughed at him and said:,0
It’s more than likely that Dummy will cut his own head off – but it won’t be much of a loss to anyone.,1
"Before he left she gave him some cake that she had burned almost to a crust in the oven, and a bottle of sour beer to wash it down.",0
"As the youngest boy was going through the woods, he met the same little grey old man who had crossed the path of his brothers.",0
The man said to him:,0
Do please share some of your cake and beer with me.,1
"I am so terribly hungry and thirsty, and I fear that if I don’t have something to eat and drink soon, I will surely die",1
The young boy replied:,0
"Old man, I will gladly share with you what I have – but the cake is burnt and the beer is sour.",1
"Never mind that,",1
said the man.,0
I am grateful for what you can give me.,1
The boy and the little grey old man sat down and shared the cake and the beer.,0
"After they had finished their lunch, the man said:",0
"Since you have a good heart, and have shared what you have with me, I will give you a reward.",1
You see that old tree over there.,1
Cut it down with your axe and you will find something of value inside its hollow trunk.,1
"So when the little grey old man had left, the young boy, whose parents called him",0
Dummy,1
", took his axe and cut down the hollow tree just as he had been told.",0
"Inside he found a goose – but this was no ordinary bird, for its feathers were made of gold.",0
"The boy realised that he was in luck, and thought to himself:",0
Why should I go home now and suffer the insults of my parents and brothers?,1
"They will take this valuable bird from me, and I shall have nothing.",1
So the boy decided to run away from home.,0
He put the golden goose under his arm and set out for the town.,0
"Then he went to the inn, intending to stay there.",0
He stood at the bar and asked the innkeeper if he would accept a golden feather as payment for his board and lodgings.,0
"When the innkeeper saw the golden goose, he readily agreed.",0
After the boy had gone to bed he said to his three daughters:,0
That young boy whose parents call Dummy is staying up in our guest room.,1
But he can’t be as simple in the head as they say – for he’s got a valuable bird with him – a goose with feathers made of gold.,1
The eldest daughter thought to herself:,0
Well fancy that;,1
feathers made of gold.,1
I’ll pluck one or maybe more of those for myself.,1
"After the clock struck midnight, she sneaked into the boy’s room, and saw that he was asleep with his arm around the golden goose.",0
"She crept up and tried to pluck a feather, but the feather wouldn’t budge, and when she tried to take her hand away, she found that she was stuck to it.",0
"She couldn’t move, and she couldn’t cry out for fear of waking the boy.",0
"She had to stay where she was – on her knees by the bed, with her hand on the feather.",0
"After the clock struck one in the morning, the second sister came in the room, planning to take one feather or more for herself.",0
"In the dark she didn’t see her sister, but as soon as she touched her back, she found that her hand was stuck fast to her, and she had to stay where she was, not moving and not making a sound.",0
"After the clock struck two in the morning, the third sister came in.",0
The other two shouted:,0
Stay back!,1
But it was too late – she reached out hoping to steal a feather and found that her hand was stuck to the middle sister.,0
The boy and the goose slept soundly through all of this.,0
"In the morning the boy got up, paid his bill with a golden feather, and left the inn with the goose under his arm.",0
The sisters had no choice but to follow on behind him.,0
What a pretty procession they made!,0
Along the way they met the bishop:,0
What a sight!,1
He exclaimed.,0
It’s hardly right for three young women to follow a boy around like that!,1
As the girls went past he tapped the youngest on the shoulder.,0
In doing so he found that he was stuck to her and had to follow.,0
Further up the road they met a police sergeant.,0
The bishop called out to him:,0
Sergeant. Help me get free from this young woman’s shoulder.,1
I’m stuck to her and people are bound to start all kinds of gossip about it!,1
"The police sergeant tried to pull the bishop free, but in doing so he found that both his hands were stuck to his waist, and he had to follow along with the procession.",0
At the top of the road they met the mayor.,0
What’s this town coming to?,1
Cried the mayor.,0
The bishop and the police sergeant are following three young girls who are following a young boy;,1
all holding on to each other in a most unseemly fashion.,1
Have they gone mad?,1
"As he spoke, he tried to pull the police sergeant and the bishop away – but in doing so he found that he was stuck to both of them, and had to follow on.",0
"The boy led the little line of the townspeople along up the road, and at the top of the hill they passed the King’s palace.",0
"Now the King’s daughter was very beautiful, but she had the saddest face in the whole wide world.",0
She had never laughed and not once even smiled.,0
"The King was so troubled by the young princess’ unhappiness, that he had made a special law:",0
Whosoever could make her laugh and smile would win her hand in marriage.,0
But the truth was that nothing very funny ever happened inside the royal palace.,0
All the King’s servants and advisers were far too high and mighty to understand what would make a young girl laugh – or indeed to allow anything amusing to happen at all.,0
"As the boy, known as Dummy, went past the palace, he still held the golden goose under his arm;",0
"and he was followed by the innkeeper’s three daughters, the bishop, the police sergeant, and the mayor.",0
The princess looked out and saw the important people in their uniforms being tugged along behind three girls and a boy with a goose.,0
She thought that it was the first thing she had seen in her life that was truly funny.,0
"She burst out laughing and ran, still giggling, to her father to tell him all about what she had seen.",0
"When the King looked out of his window and saw the procession, he couldn’t help laughing himself.",0
He sent for his guards and told them to bring the boy and his followers directly to him.,0
"When the boy entered the King’s chamber, with the followers behind him;",0
"the mayor, the bishop and the policeman all called out angrily that he should pay for his crime with his head.",0
"The king, still laughing, said that on the contrary – he would be rewarded with the hand in marriage of his daughter, the princess.",0
"For an entire week after that, the innkeeper’s three daughters, the bishop, the policeman, and the mayor were all stuck to the golden goose and to one another.",0
"While they were stuck, all the townspeople and the whole court laughed and laughed at them.",0
The boy whose family called him Dummy married the princess and inherited the kingdom.,0
"He lived with his beautiful wife and they had six happy smiling children, and the palace was often filled with laughter.",0

"Oh dear,",1
thought the Mayor.,0
He probably wants to miss our card game.,1
"He always claims he’s busy fighting crime, but I know he just doesn’t like losing.",1
And so he reluctantly flipped open his phone.,0
"His Honour the Mayor speaking,",1
he said in a weary voice.,0
"Good morning Horace,",1
said the Police Chief.,0
I hope I didn’t wake you up.,1
"No, no,",1
huffed the Mayor.,0
"I’ve been at my desk since dawn, this great city of ours never sleeps.",1
I’m afraid I’ll have have to miss tonight’s card game.,1
I’ve a serious crime to solve.,1
A kidnapping.,1
The Mayor smiled to himself.,0
"Another one of his excuses, he thought.",0
"But after he had wished the Police Chief better luck with his case than with cards, he closed his phone and reached for the remote control to turn on his television set to catch the news.",0
A red banner flashed across the bottom of the screen:,0
Breaking News:,1
"Kidnapping,",1
it said.,0
And the Mayor thought to himself that it must be somebody important that had got him or herself kidnapped.,0
And it was.,0
The reporter who was standing outside some large factory gates wore her most serious face.,0
She was saying:,0
A ransom note was sent this morning to the head of the Yummy Chocolate Factory demanding one hundred million pounds for the safe return of one the most loved and respected creatures who has ever hopped across the planet.,1
"And the Mayor understood that it wasn’t a person, but an animal who had been kidnapped.",0
But what sort of animal could it be that was worth one hundred million pounds?,0
Even a champion racehorse was scarcely worth such a fortune?,0
Perhaps some old aristocratic lady with more money than sense had lost her favourite pussy cat?,0
But why was the note sent to the Head of the Chocolate Factory?,0
He’d just have to keep listening to that reporter on the twenty-four Hour News Service.,0
"And joining me now is The President and CEO of the Yummy Chocolate Factory, Sir Percival Yummy. Sir Percival, Easter is just around the corner.",1
How will the Chocolate Factory cope without the services of the Easter Bunny?,1
"I’m afraid the situation is very grave,",1
said Sir Percival.,0
"Without the aid of the Easter Bunny, it’s simply impossible to deliver chocolate eggs to all the children of the world all in one night.",1
It’s a bit like Christmas without Santa Clause...,1
"it’s, it’s ..",1
.unthinkable.,1
And the Mayor thought that Sir Percival was about to cry.,0
The reporter did not seem to notice this.,0
So will you pay the one hundred million pound ransom?,1
she pressed him.,0
"No we will not,",1
he replied steadfastly.,0
It is the policy of the Yummy Chocolate Factory never to pay ransom money under any circumstances.,1
That would simply encourage more kidnapping.,1
It took a moment for the seriousness of the situation to sink into the Mayor’s brain.,0
"When it did, he leapt out of bed faster than he had done for years and ran down to his office, still in his pyjamas.",0
He turned on his computer and saw hundreds of emails downloading into his inbox.,0
"Many were from anxious parents, teachers and nannies with subjects like:",0
"Help, my kids are going hysterical and won’t stop crying...",1
And then there was another email from the chief gardener entitled:,0
"So, shall we cancel the Easter Egg Hunt?",1
"The Easter Egg hunt took place every year in the grounds of the Mayor’s House. The Easter Bunny hid eggs behind the flowers and in the bushes, and children from all over the city came and searched for them.",0
"It was one of the most popular events of the year, and showed the Mayor as a politician with a heart, who cared for families and children.",0
It won him lots of votes.,0
By now he was starting to grow angry.,0
He picked up his red telephone and shouted,0
Get me the Chief of Police!,1
And a minute later he was again talking to his friend:,0
You blithering idiot!,1
he cried.,0
Why haven’t you found that bunny yet?,1
"The Chief of Police was used to his old friend’s swings of mood, and he replied calmly:",0
"Horace, rest assured that the finest crime fighting unit in the land is on the case, and at this very moment is rounding up the usual suspects.",1
And at the top of the Police Chief’s list was a name which we have come across before:,0
It belonged to somebody who was known to go quite berserk at the merest sniff of chocolate.,0
"He lived in the city zoo, he was a monkey, and his name was Theo. If you’ve heard the story called",0
The Monkey Who Loved Chocolate,1
you will know that Theo once ate some chocolate and went completely bananas.,0
He went on the rampage stealing chocolate all over the place.,0
"It was coming up to Easter and there was almost no chocolate left for the children of the city, but Theo calmed down eventually, and promised to be good.",0
His hairy face was currently staring out of the Police Chief’s computer screen.,0
"Normally his round brown eyes were cheeky but cute, but at the time his police photograph had been taken, he was startled by the flash and looked like a completely crazy ape.",0
"Ooh, he looks like a bad’un,",1
said a woman Police Officer who was passing by.,0
"No worries,",1
said the Police Chief.,0
We’ll soon have him behind bars.,1
But of course Theo was already living behind bars in the zoo.,0
"And much to his surprise and delight, that morning he had found a chocolate egg in his bed of straw, and he had gobbled it up and was now swinging across the roof of the cage screeching",0
"Ooo Ooo, Ah Ah Aha!",1
"When the police came to arrest him, his face was covered in brown chocolate, and that made him look especially guilty.",0
The police sergeant said:,0
There he is.,1
"That’s the bunny snatcher – and constable, put on your white gloves and pick up all that chocolate-smudged silver foil – that’s evidence that is.",1
"Mr Grabber, who was the zoo keeper in charge of the monkeys, tried and catch Theo, but it wasn’t easy because he kept swinging around the bars.",0
"While this was all happening, a police dog got chatting to a bull dog whose name was Titanic. Titanic was a squat, muscular, squash-faced animal, and not the brightest canine who ever lived.",0
"His owner was Mr Grabber, and wherever Mr Grabber went, Titanic went too.",0
"Perhaps I should have been a police dog,",1
"said Titanic,",0
because I’m really good at catching things.,1
"Only yesterday, I saw a white rabbit sneaking into the monkeys’ cage and chatting to that Theo. When he came out, I chased him into a corner by the visitor’s toilets, and I would have gobbled him up, only Mr Grabber came along and popped him into a bag, and now he’s keeping him in a hutch behind the Llamas’ enclosure.",1
"There’s something very unusual about that rabbit, because he smells, not like he’s supposed to, but like chocolate.",1
"I hope we have him for dinner tonight, because I’d really like to try what he tastes like.",1
"And when the police dog heard this, he understood that they had come to arrest an innocent monkey.",0
"Because it wasn’t Theo who had kidnapped the Easter Bunny, but Mr Grabber and his bull dog.",0
"Eventually, when the police threatened to shoot him with a dart that would make him go to sleep, Theo decided to come quietly.",0
"He was put under arrest, hand-cuffed, loaded into the police van, and driven away at high speed with the blue light flashing and the siren going",0
De De De De De De.,1
"When they got to the police station, Theo was led into a cage.",0
"But unlike the cage at the zoo, this one was small, dark, and not very nice – because it was a police cell.",0
Theo screeched,0
"Help, let me out.",1
I’ve been framed!,1
But the police officers could not understand.,0
All they heard was,0
EEK Ahha Ahha!,1
An hour later the Mayor was standing on the lawn outside his office and talking to the reporter from the twenty-four Hour News station.,0
He looked into the TV camera and said:,0
I am delighted to tell you that I have successfully guided our city through this grave crisis and the situation is now under control.,1
"The villain who committed this terrible crime is behind bars, and tomorrow he will be tried and found guilty and then I will personally throw away the key to his prison cell.",1
"But Mayor,",1
"said the reporter,",0
any news of the missing bunny?,1
"No more time for questions, duty calls",1
"said the Mayor, and he turned round and went back to his office.",0
"The hours went by, and Theo began to feel very sad and lonely, and a bit frightened.",0
A policeman brought him some bread and water and offered him a chance to make one phone call.,0
But Theo didn’t have anyone to call.,0
"And then a lawyer came to see him, and they went up to an interview room where a police officer turned on a tape recorder and said:",0
"You have a right to remain silent, and any thing you say may be taken down and used in a court of law as evidence against you.",1
And Theo said:,0
"Oooh, ah ah ah.",1
And then they took him back to his cell.,0
"It was a few hours later, as Theo tried to sleep, that he heard the jangling of keys.",0
He buried his head in the pillow and pretended not to notice.,0
Then a gruff voice said:,0
"Come on, wake up.",1
It’s time we sprung you out of here.,1
He opened his eyes and saw that it was a police dog with keys in his mouth.,0
"In a jiffy, Theo had sprung up, reached through the bars for the keys, and climbed up to get the lock open.",0
"Monkeys are highly intelligent primates you see, and it’s not at all difficult for them to do such things.",0
"Put on this blue coat,",1
said the dog.,0
It was a sort of jacket that police dogs sometimes wear.,0
The word,0
Police,1
was written on the back.,0
Theo put it on.,0
"Now try and act like a police dog,",1
said the dog.,0
"But as they walked together through the busy part of the station, a policeman said",0
"I didn’t know we were using monkeys on the force,",1
and another policeman said:,0
I expect that they climb in through windows and catch criminals by surprise.,1
"Still, nobody stopped them, and soon they were out on the street and running down the road.",0
"On the corner, they paused for breath, and the dog explained what he had heard about Mr Grabber kidnapping the Easter Bunny.",0
"I might have known it,",1
said Theo.,0
"He’s a REAL villain, that Mr Grabber.",1
But the important thing was that Theo knew where the Easter Bunny was being kept prisoner – at the back of the llama pen.,0
"He caught a forty-nine bus straight back to the zoo, and soon was able to find his old friend and release him from his hutch.",0
"I don’t need to tell you how glad the bunny was to be let free, not least because it was his busiest time of year and he had so much work to do before Easter. He would have just loved to go straight to the police station and tell them all about Mr Grabber, but he couldn’t do that, because, well he was a bunny you see.",0
So he ran back straight to his secret hideaway to catch up on sorting out his Easter Eggs. The next morning the Mayor sat up in bed and turned on his television set to see if there had been any developments over night in the case of the missing bunny.,0
A red banner flashed across the screen saying:,0
Breaking News. Monkey Escapes.,1
And the reporter was saying:,0
The chief suspect in the case of the missing Easter Bunny has escaped from police custody.,1
The Mayor rushed down to his office and was about to pick up his red phone and demand the immediate sacking of the Chief of Police when he noticed a little envelope on his desk.,0
"The envelope was sealed with with wax and imprinted with a secret sign – a sign which very few people know and recognise, but fortunately the Mayor was one of them.",0
"It was the seal of the Easter Bunny, and every year he used it to communicate with the Mayor and to arrange the annual Easter Egg hunt.",0
"That’s strange,",1
said they Mayor. And he fumbled open the envelope.,0
Inside he found a card and on the card was written the following words.,0
"Dear Mayor. The Monkey is Innocent. Yours Sincerely, The Easter Bunny.",1

"Christmas is the happiest time of year, but sometimes something terrible happens – like a kid misses it all together.",0
That’s what happened one year to a girl called Natalie. Natalie’s life was almost perfect – apart from her annoying little brother called Joe. There was just one thing she didn’t like doing – and that was getting up in the morning.,0
Her Dad was always warning that one day she would miss something important.,0
And one day she did.,0
But fortunately this is time of year when no problem can’t be solved....,0
with just a little magic.,0

"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. The Girl Who Missed Christmas - Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Natalie. Natalie was six.",0
"She lived in a nice house, on a nice street.",0
"She had a little brother called Joe, and a dog called Marmalade. And most of the time Natalie was happy.",0
She played with her friends.,0
She played with her dog.,0
Sometimes she even played with Joe – when he wasn’t being annoying.,0
But there was one thing Natalie didn’t like.,0
Getting up.,0
Every morning her Dad would come into her room and say:,0
"C’mon Natalie, time to get up.",1
And Natalie would say:,0
Just one more minute.,1
"Now, now, you’ll be late for school,",1
said Dad.,0
"Just one tiny minute,",1
Natalie would say.,0
Pleeeeeeease.....,1
"Now, Natalie.",1
"It’s so warm in bed,",1
Natalie would moan.,0
And so it went on every morning.,0
Dad would shout at Natalie to get up.,0
Mum would shout at her.,0
And Marmalade the dog would bark.,0
And Joe would already be up.,0
And then Mum would shout at her again.,0
And the dog would bark even louder.,0
But Natalie just pulled the cover over her ears.,0
"Because Natalie just really, really, really hated getting out of bed in the morning.",0
"You know, Natalie, one day you’re going to miss something really important because you stay in bed too long,",1
"said Dad. As it happened, something very important was about to happen.",0
"The nights were getting longer, and the leaves were falling from the trees, and soon Natalie was getting very excited because it was getting close to Christmas. And she had so many different things she had asked for.",0
She wanted a new game for her Nintendo DS. And a doll that cried real tears.,0
And a new DVD. And lots and lots and lots of things.,0
"Of course, she had to rehearse for the school play – except she nearly missed it because she was sleeping in.",0
And she had to go and see Santa in the grotto – but she nearly missed that as well because she didn’t want to get out of bed.,0
"I just don’t know what to do about all this sleeping,",1
said Mum. But Natalie didn’t care.,0
"If I want to stay in bed, why shouldn’t I?",0
she decided to herself.,0
So finally Christmas Eve arrived.,0
And Natalie was so excited she found it really hard to get to sleep.,0
She wanted to stay and see if she could really see Santa. She tried ever so hard to stay awake as long as she could.,0
"But eventually, she went off to sleep.",0
And she slept.,0
And slept.,0
And slept.,0
"At one point she heard Dad coming into the room to wake her – but she just rolled over, put the pillow over her head, and went back to sleep again.",0
Finally she decided she had been so long in bed that it was starting to get boring.,0
She pulled away the pillow and looked towards the window.,0
It was morning.,0
"Wow, it’s Christmas day,",1
said Natalie.,0
I’m so excited.,1
She looked towards the end of her bed.,0
But where was the stocking?,0
she wondered.,0
Where had Santa left all his toys?,0
"Natalie jumped out of bed, and ran downstairs.",0
She was quite out of breath – because she’d never jumped out of bed before.,0
"Mum, Dad, its Christmas,",1
she shouted.,0
She glanced around the room.,0
Joe was playing with a new toy car.,0
Mum was folding away some used wrapping paper.,0
"Dad was reading a boring looking book with no pictures — in fact, the sort of book Mum gave him every year.",0
And Marmalade the dog was eating something that looked suspiciously like turkey leftovers.,0
"Mum, Dad, it’s Christmas,",1
"shouted Natalie, even louder this time.",0
There was a silence.,0
Everyone looked at her – everyone that is except Marmalade who was busy eating turkey.,0
It’s Christmas...isn’t it?,1
"said Natalie, more quietly now.",0
"You mean, it was Christmas,",1
said Dad.,0
"You slept right through,",1
said Mum.,0
"We tried to wake you,",1
said Dad.,0
"But, but, but....",1
said Natalie.,0
"I told you you’d miss something important one day,",1
said Dad.,0
"It was really good,",1
said Joe.,0
"We had loads of food, and loads of presents.",1
"And I missed it,",1
wailed Natalie. And she started to cry.,0
And cry.,0
And cry.,0
"Sorry,",1
said Dad.,0
"It also means you didn’t get any presents from Santa. But don’t worry, there will be another Christmas next year.",1
"It’s not faaaaair,",1
wailed Natalie.,0
"But I always told you you’d miss something important if you didn’t get out of bed in time,",1
said Dad.,0
"Now, help me clear away all this wrapping paper....",1
But Natalie just walked out of the house.,0
She walked through the garden.,0
And across the park.,0
"When she got there, she cried and cried.",0
She was so upset about missing Christmas. And she didn’t know how she could wait for a whole year.,0
"Now, it so happened that it was still very early in the morning.",0
"And the sun was only just coming up, so it was still quite dark.",0
"And at that very moment, Santa was just trudging his way across the sky in his sleigh on his way back to Lapland. He was very tired.",0
"And so were the reindeer, because they’d been all around the world delivering presents to all the children.",0
"But, even though he was tired, he couldn’t help noticing one little girl sitting on a park bench all by herself.",0
And crying and crying.,0
"Whoa there Rudolf,",1
said Santa.,0
I wonder what’s wrong with that girl.,1
"Maybe she didn’t like her presents,",1
"said Rudolf, who was hungry and tired, and wanted to get back to his grotto to get some food.",0
Kids today!,1
No gratitude....,1
"We better see,",1
said Santa. And so he pulled the sleigh down into the park.,0
What’s the matter?,1
"asked Santa. But Natalie was so upset, she just kept crying, and her eyes were so full of water she couldn’t see anything.",0
"Huh, she’s probably upset because she only got one Nintendo, ten Polly Pockets, and a dozen Barbie dolls,",1
said Rudolph.,0
Kids today!,1
When I started this job they were happy with a small piece of wood and an orange.,1
The stuff you have to carry noawadays.,1
It’s hardly surprising my back hurts.,1
Didn’t you like your presents?,1
"said Santa. Natalie rubbed her eyes, and then looked up.",0
And she gasped.,0
Santa was sitting right next to her.,0
"Oh-my-gosh,",1
she said.,0
Is it....you?,1
"Shhhhh,",1
said Santa.,0
You see I’m not really supposed to show myself to children.,1
"We’ll be in trouble for this,",1
moaned Rudolph.,0
I told you we should have gone straight home.,1
But Natalie gave Santa a hug.,0
"You see Santa, I slept right through Christmas....and now I’ve missed it.",1
"Oh dear, oh dear,",1
said Santa. Then he looked towards the house.,0
"We’ve still got a few things left in the sack,",1
he said.,0
"So go inside, and check the fireplace in your bedroom in a few minutes.",1
"But, but....",1
"Just go,",1
said Santa. So Natalie stated to walk home.,0
And Santa went back to his sleigh.,0
"We’re not doing another delivery are we,",1
said Rudolph.,0
"Because, that’s overtime, that’s what that is...I’ll need an extra carrot for that.",1
"Oh, c’mon you lazy animal,",1
said Santa. And then Natalie came back into the house.,0
She couldn’t believe her eyes.,0
Jingle bells was playing on the hi-fi.,0
Everyone was wearing hats.,0
And her mum had re-heated some turkey and made some fresh roast potatoes.,0
"We thought we’d re-start Christmas,",1
said Dad.,0
Just for you.,1
"And Natalie jumped up and down, then ran upstairs.",0
"Because in the fireplace in her bedroom there was a stocking bursting with presents – there was a doll with real tears, a princess on a white pony, a game for her nintendo, and, finally, after she had opened all the other presents from Santa there was one special one from Dad – An Alarm Clock!",0
"So for the rest of the day, Natalie had the best Christmas ever.",0
And do you know what?,0
A couple of weeks later it was the first day of a new term.,0
Dad came into the bedroom.,0
"Wake up, Natalie. Time to go back to school,",1
he said.,0
The he looked around.,0
"Natalie,",1
"he said, sounding worried.",0
Natalie..,1
But he couldn’t see her anywhere.,0
Then he heard a voice from downstairs.,0
So he rushed down to kitchen.,0
"And Natalie was out of bed, had put on her school uniform and brushed her hair, and had made breakfast for everyone.",0
"I’m never going to be late for anything again, Dad,",1
she said.,0
Which side are you on – the Giants or the Gods?,0
"When you’ve listened to the story, you can leave a comment and let us know.",0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Pictures by CaiJia.  Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Hello, this is Natasha and this is our latest story about Katie the witch.",0
"I ought to mention that there aren’t actually any giants in this story, so I hope you aren’t too disappointed about that.",0
"After all, Katie is an ordinary school girl, and it would be quite surprising if giants suddenly appeared in the playground.",0
But giants are important to the story.,0
– as you will hear.,0
There was a new girl at school.,0
Her name was Jazz and you might have thought that she would be quite shy until she had time to settle in.,0
Katie thought:,0
"Poor Jazz, starting a school is such a big thing.",1
She must be quite scared really.,1
"After the first lesson, she went up to her and said:",0
"Hi, My name’s Katie. Don’t worry, we’re all pretty friendly here.",1
Well most of us are...,1
Jazz frowned and stared past Katie’s face in a strange way.,0
She said:,0
Couldn’t you find your hairbrush this morning?,1
"Samantha laughed at this remark, and made an action like a monster:",0
"Katie’s hair is always WILD,",1
she exclaimed.,0
And then she added with a toss of thumb:,0
She’s the weird one.,1
Jazz said:,0
"Yes, I see that.",1
Every class has one of those.,1
Katie felt so hurt it was like Jazz had hit her.,0
She decided to avoid her.,0
"But at lunchtime, lots of other people wanted to chat to the new girl, and she was instantly popular.",0
"Her mum was a presenter on one of those TV shows about buying a house that was a bit of a tip, and then doing it up to be a dream home.",0
Everyone thought that was super-cool.,0
Even Katie’s best friend Isis was impressed.,0
"So all in all, it was quite surprising when Jazz came up to Katie the next day.",0
Katie innocently thought that perhaps she wanted to apologise or say something kind to make up for the bad start.,0
But she was wrong.,0
Jazz said coolly:,0
People say you’re a witch.,1
"People say lots of things,",1
"said Katie, walking a little faster down the corridor towards the art class.",0
"I was in your mum’s magic crystal shop yesterday,",1
she went on.,0
What are those things supposed to do?,1
"Magic things can make your house have good energy,",1
said Katie.,0
They can give you positive vibes.,1
"Well that doesn’t do anything for me,",1
said Jazz.,0
"My motto is, If you can’t see it, eat it, or spend it, then it’s no good to anyone.",1
"In fact, I don’t believe in magic.",1
"What you can’t touch, doesn’t exist.",1
"Yeah, Katie’s mum is just selling fake spells,",1
"said Samantha, who was also walking along with them:",0
A fake witch is worse than a real one if you ask me.,1
"Well nobody is asking you,",1
said Katie.,0
"Actually, I’m asking her,",1
said Jenny.,0
"Samantha, what do you think of Katie, her mum, and their shop?",1
"Fake, fake fake,",1
said Samantha. And Jazz and Jenny thought that was hilarious.,0
"Katie was used to being teased, but it particularly upset her when people said bad things about her mum.",0
"That evening she was still feeling glum, and she said to her mother:",0
"There’s a new girl at school who says that if you can’t see, spend, or eat something then it’s no good to anyone.",1
"Well that’s nonsense,",1
said her mum who was busy mending an antique magic belt that was embroidered with all sorts of mysterious patterns.,0
There are lots of really important things that you can’t touch or see.,1
"You mean like magic?,",1
asked Katie.,0
"Because lots of people don’t believe it, so they think that we witches are fakes.",1
"It’s not just magic that you can’t see,",1
said her mum.,0
And it’s not just magic that lots of folk don’t believe in.,1
"There have always been two types of people, and there always will be.",1
You mean like witches and ordinary people?,1
"Not quite,",1
said her mother.,0
"Now, Katie, if you get your magic homework book, I’m going to tell you a story from Ancient Greece that explains what I am talking about.",1
"It’s a myth, so it’s not exactly true, but it has a deeper meaning....",1
that’s something lots of people find hard to understand too.,1
"According to the story, there are two great forces in the world.",1
"There are the giants who rule the Earth, and the Gods who rule the heavens.",1
"The giants are always trying to grab hold of anything that is solid, like rocks, trees, or buildings, and pull them to the ground.",1
"They want to dig up all the precious gold and silver that they can find, because they think that wealth will make them powerful.",1
"They plan to destroy the mountains that hold up the sky, so that the Gods will come tumbling down to Earth. But the Gods are not afraid, because they don’t care about solid things.",1
They value what you can’t touch or see.,1
"This war goes on and on, and it always will.",1
"We know this story from a wise man called Socrates, and it’s still just as true today as it was in ancient times.",1
"And when Katie still looked puzzled, her mum said that she was going to set some witch’s homework.",0
"By the end of the week, she had to find three important and valuable things that you can’t see, touch, spend, or eat – excluding magic.",0
"And although Katie thought that this was the strangest homework she had ever been set, she agreed to do her best.",0
"The next day, Katie could not see anything invisible at all – which was not surprising when you come to think about it.",0
"Isis promised to help her look for something important that you can’t see, but she couldn’t find anything like that either – even though both of them kept looking hard right up until the bell for the end of school.",0
Her mum looked glum when she came to collect her.,0
Is anything the matter?,1
asked Katie.,0
The owner of the shop is putting up my the rent.,1
I don’t think I can pay it.,1
I’ll have to close at the end of the summer.,1
Oh that’s terrible!,1
"said Katie giving her mother a hug, and trying not to burst into tears.",0
As her head rested against her mother’s chest she thought:,0
Perhaps Jazz is right.,1
Real things like money count for more than stuff you can’t see.,1
"Just as it seemed that life could not get any worse, it did.",0
"Their teacher, Miss Vile said to the class:",0
This year’s school trip will be to a very special place.,1
We are going to New York!,1
Everyone was super-excited because the furthest the school had ever been before was Clacton-on-Sea. But the letter they took home told their parents that the cost of the trip would be £eight hundred.,0
Katie knew that her mother could not afford it.,0
"Don’t worry Mum,",1
she said.,0
I really don’t mind about the school trip.,1
But of course she felt left out.,0
And it seemed like yet more proof that things like money really do matter most in life.,0
"I’m really worried,",1
"said Katie to Isis, the next day,",0
because bad things always happen in threes.,1
What awful thing can happen to me today?,1
"Don’t believe that nonsense,",1
"said Isis,",0
It’s only superstition.,1
"And Isis was right, because nothing bad did happen that day.",0
"Mum, I’m so grateful nothing bad happened today,",1
said Katie when she got home.,0
"Well done darling,",1
said her mum.,0
"That’s one important thing you have found that you can’t see, touch or eat.",1
Have I?,1
What?,1
said Katie puzzled.,0
"Gratitude,",1
said her mum.,0
"We must always be grateful for anything good that happens, or anything bad that doesn’t happen.",1
In fact we must be grateful for all the happiness and good fortunes that we have.,1
Gratitude makes us much more content with life.,1
"Oh I see,",1
said Katie.,0
Now I’m beginning to understand.,1
It was Friday. Katie was secretly pleased that she had managed to get to the end of such a bad week.,0
Isis’s mum picked her up from school to come over for a sleep-over.,0
It was going to be such fun.,0
"I spoke to your mum today,",1
she said.,0
And she’s agreed that you can come pony trekking again with us at the half-term.,1
Katie was amazed.,0
But isn’t Isis going on the school trip at half-term?,1
she asked.,0
"She doesn’t want to go to New York without her best-friend,",1
said Isis’s mum.,0
"And Katie realised that she had found another really, really important thing that you can’t see or touch:",0
friendship.,0
"Katie and Isis chatted long after light’s out about all sorts of things, but mostly about the important things that you can’t see, eat or spend.",0
"I still don’t know who is right though,",1
"said Katie,",0
"The giants who believe in solid things like money and riches, or the Gods who believe in things like gratitude and friendship.",1
"If you could see how worried Mum is about having to close the shop, you couldn’t fail to see that money is really important.",1
"I’m not sure that you are right,",1
"said Katie,",0
But I do hope that you are.,1
Katie’s mum came to pick her up from Isis’s house after tea on Saturday. The girls had been out to the pony farm to ride Isis’s horse and had enjoyed a lovely day.,0
Katie noticed that her mum’s face looked far more relaxed than last time she had seen her.,0
In the car she said:,0
"Tell me Mum, have you got some good news?",1
"I have,",1
replied her mum.,0
And she explained that a woman from a TV show called,0
DES RES,1
which was short for,0
"Desirable Residence,",1
"had been into the shop several times, and wanted to feature it in her next series.",0
"She loved some of the wooden statues and beautifully embroidered cushions, and she thought that they would feature in a make-over of an old-run down country house, which could be turned into some sort of Aladdin’s Palace.",0
said Katie.,0
Her daughter is in my class at school.,1
Her name is Jazz and she said all sorts of horrible snooty things about your shop.,1
Well her mother loves it!,1
said Katie’s mum thrilled.,0
"And the landlord says he won’t put the rent up for another year if we are on TV, because publicity will be good for the whole street.",1
And of course it wouldn’t look nice for him if the TV show heard that he was being mean to us and that we had to close down.,1
Katie was thrilled.,0
She thought:,0
This is perfect revenge on Jazz. She’ll have to eat her words.,1
"And she realised that revenge was something you can’t see, but she also knew that her mum would not approve of it, so she did not say what she was thinking.",0
"On Monday, she went to school with a spring in her step.",0
"As luck would have it, she and Jazz both arrived in the classroom a few minutes early.",0
They were alone together.,0
Jazz said:,0
Katie there’s something I want to say to you.,1
What’s that?,1
said Katie getting ready for some nasty barbed comment.,0
"Sorry,",1
said Jazz. Katie was amazed.,0
She was more stunned than the time Jazz had been really mean to her.,0
And she realised that she had discovered two more really important but invisible things.,0
"Apologising, and forgiveness.",0
And that was the story of Katie and the Giants. I do hope that you enjoyed it.,0
Which side are you on..,0
The Giants or the Gods?,0
"Or perhaps sometimes you are on one side, and other times on the other?",0
It’s something to think about.,0
"And for those who like to know about this sort of thing, the original story of the Giants and the Gods can be found in a book called The Sophist by Plato. Our Katie stories are one of our most popular series on Storynory.com.",0
"There are many more stories on the site too, so do drop by and listen to some soon.",0
"And you might like to know that you can now listen to our Story, Katie and the Witch’s swap, for free on the site.",0
But if you can buy our iPhone and iPad app with seventeen original illustrations for story that would be fantastic.,0
"And thanks too to everyone who bought the Witch’s Swap story when it was for sale, and to everyone who has made donations to Storynory. For now, from me, Natasha Bye Bye!",0
"If you like SCARY STORIES, then this one is for you.",0
"We are putting it out for Halloween, but you can listen any time of year IF YOU DARE!",0
Baba Yaga is a famous witch of the East. She has spooked and scared little children across Eastern Europe for many a year.,0
This is a her most famous story.,0
A wicked Step-Mother sends Vasilisa to visit the witch in her hut in the woods to ask for some lights.,0
She’s pretty sure that that will be the last she ever sees of her stepdaughter – but is she right?,0
"Version for Storynory by Bertie. Somewhere in the eastern part of Europe, where it gets bitterly cold in winter, there is a dark forest.",0
"If you are ever brave, foolish or ignorant enough to go wandering through that forest, there is a good chance that you might come across a peculiar house.",0
"It’s a wooden hut, but it’s like no other that you have ever seen, for it stands on giant chicken legs – and quite often it walks about, just like a monstrous farm yard bird.",0
"This hut is the home of Baba Yaga. I don’t advise that you knock at the door of Baba Yaga’s hut, no matter how much you have lost your way through the forest – for Baba Yaga is a witch.",0
"On the edge of Baba Yaga’s forest, there is a little village, and everyone who lives there knows about the strange hut and the lady who lives inside it.",0
"They know her, and they fear her, for it has long been rumoured that she likes to eat children.",0
"A long time ago, a man lived in this village with his beautiful daughter, who was called Vasilisa. The girl’s mother had sadly died some years before the start of this story.",0
"Before she died, she gave Vasilisa a wonderful gift – It was a little rag doll that did not look so different from any other.",0
The girl’s mother told Vasilisa that she should take special care of the doll.,0
"Every night she must feed it a little milk and a little biscuit, and so long as she did so, the doll would always be ready to help her – no matter how much trouble she found herself in.",0
Vasilisa did just as her mother bid her.,0
"Every night the little rag doll sat up and drank a little milk, and ate a little biscuit before smiling at Vasilisa and then going back to sleep.",0
"As time went by, the girl’s father decided to marry again.",0
"His second wife had two daughters of her own, neither of whom could touch Vasilisa for beauty or sweetness of character.",0
"In fact, they were jealous of Vasilisa and they hated her terribly.",0
"So long as Vasilisa’s father remained at home, the stepmother and stepsisters had to pretend that they liked her, but every now and then one of the sisters would whisper in Vasilisa’s ear,",0
Just you wait until your dear papa leaves us alone with you.,1
Then you’ll see!,1
"When Vasilisa had recently passed her sixteenth birthday, her father said that he had to go away on a journey that would last at least a month.",0
"Vasilisa begged him to take her with him, but he just laughed and said he was travelling on business, and the girl would find the journey tiresome and dull.",0
"The first night after the father had left, the stepmother gathered the three girls together in the parlour and spoke as such:",0
"Now my dears, I have a little task for each of you.",0
"Tanya,",1
"that was the oldest,",0
"go in my room, please my dear, and sew a button on my red dress.",1
"Katya,",1
"the youngest,",0
go to the kitchen table and roll some pastry so that it’s nice and flat.,1
"And Vasilisa dear, go to Baba Yaga’s hut in the forest and ask her to lend us some lights.",1
Now run along sweetheart.,1
Don’t waste any time.,1
We don’t want you to get caught in the dark now do we.,1
The stepmother shooed Vasilisa out of the house so fast that she hardly had time to put on her hat and gloves.,0
She walked forlornly to the corner of the street and took the little doll out of her coat pocket where it had been sleeping.,0
"Oh little doll,",1
she said.,0
"My mother told me that if I fed and looked after you, you would be ready to help me if I was ever in trouble.",1
Well I have fed and looked after you.,1
Now I’m in terrible trouble.,1
"I must go to Baba Yaga, and everyone knows that she is a dreadfully wicked witch.",1
So please tell me – what am I to do?,1
The little doll looked up at Vasilisa and said:,0
Be as brave as you are beautiful.,1
Go to Baba Yaga’s hut and no harm will come to you.,1
"Vasilisa mustered up all her courage and walked down the path that led through the woods to the hut of Baba Yaga. After a while, the young girl heard the sound of galloping hooves coming up behind her, and she stepped off the road to let a horse ridden by a rider in a blazing red cloak shoot past her.",0
I wonder who that was?,1
Thought Vasilisa before setting off on a her way once more.,0
"A little further on, she once again heard the sound of galloping hooves, and this time a rider in a cloak of dazzling white sped past her and down the road that led to Baba Yaga’s hut.",0
"Some time later, a third horse shot by.",0
Its rider wore a cloak that was as black as night.,0
"After about an hour of walking, Vasilisa came to a clearing in the forest.",0
"Although it was now getting quite dark, she had no trouble seeing – for this neck of the woods was lit by skulls with blazing eyes.",0
The skulls were mounted on top of a high fence.,0
"Beyond the fence, she saw the strange hut that stood on chicken legs.",0
"It turned around to face her, and it seemed to Vasilisa that the hut was looking at her.",0
Then the chicken legs began to kneel and the hut lowered to the ground.,0
The door creaked open.,0
Baba Yaga’s nose was so long and bony that it appeared through the door before the rest of her.,0
"A moment or two later the nose was followed by a tall, skinny old woman holding a broom stick.",0
Vasilissa was so frightened that her legs would not obey her when she told them to run.,0
The old lady came towards her – but she did not walk – her feet flew just a few inches above the ground.,0
"Well child,",1
"she said,",0
Did the cat get your tongue?,1
Or are you just badly brought up?,1
Speak Child!,1
Spit out your name and your business here!,1
I haven’t got all night to hover around while you tremble and gibber like an idiot!,1
"For a few moments Vasilisa’s lips quivered so much that no proper words would come out of her mouth, just a kind of",0
"ah, ah-ah,",1
"but she then remembered the doll’s words that no harm would come to her, and eventually she found courage to speak clearly.",0
"Good Ma’am,",1
she said.,0
"It is only me, little Vasilisa. My stepmother sent me to the forest to borrow a light from Baba Yaga.",1
Did she now?,1
Said Baba Yaga thoughtfully.,0
"Well I am Baba Yaga, but you may call me Babushka.",1
"Vasilisa brightened a little at this, for Babushka is a kindly name that means",0
Grandma.,1
Baba Yaga went on:,0
Now come with me into my hut.,1
I will give you some simple tasks to do.,1
"If you are not lazy and you complete your work like a good girl, then I will give you the light that you ask for and let you go free.",1
But if you do not manage these simple tasks I shall cook you in my oven and eat you for my dinner!,1
Ha Ha Ha!,1
She cackled.,0
How do you like that for an offer?,1
"To tell you the truth, Vasilisa did not like it at all, but she had faith that all would be well, that she would complete the tasks, and return with the light, and so she curtsied and said,",0
"I like it well, dear Babushka,",1
and she followed the old lady as she floated back to the door of her hut and called out:,0
"Locks, unlock!",1
"The doors creaked open, and then shut again behind Vasilisa as she stepped inside.",0
"The hut was surprisingly roomy, but a large part of it was taken up by a huge oven.",0
"Vasilisa had to hold in a scream, because the house started to rise up on its chicken legs and move about.",0
She realised that there would be no escape unless Baba Yaga let her go.,0
The witch sat down at the table and gestured to the larder.,0
"Fetch me my supper, dear,",1
she said.,0
"Yes, Babushka,",1
"replied Vasilisa, and she brought over some bread and cheese for the old lady.",0
"Ah well,",1
said Baba Yaga.,0
"Soon I shall be enjoying a nice plate of roast meat, thinly sliced and pink in the middle.",1
With those words she pinched Vasilisa’s arm.,0
"Now tomorrow my dear, you must complete my little task.",1
"When I am away from the hut, you must tidy the yard, clean the hut, and cook pumpkin soup for my supper.",1
Can you manage that?,1
"Why yes, Babushka, I can.",1
"said Vasilisa, who was relieved that the task did not sound by any means beyond her ability.",0
"That is good,",1
"said Baba Yaga,",0
and when you have finished doing that you can sort out all the kitchen pots and pans.,1
"Baba Yaga ate her bread and cheese and drank a tankard of frothy brown ale before falling asleep on top of a thick fur which was strewn above the stove, the warmest place in the hut.",0
The hut continued to move around and Vasilisa felt queasy.,0
"She certainly had no appetite herself, but before she lay down for the night, she did not forget to feed her doll a few crumbs of bread and some drops of milk.",0
"When the rag doll had finished her supper, Vasilisa asked her:",0
"Oh dear, what have I done?",1
How shall I ever get out of here?,1
The Doll replied:,0
Have courage and keep faith and all will be well – for Baba Yaga is unable to tell a lie and she is bound to keep her promise.,1
"The next morning, Baba Yaga arose from her bed on top of the stove, and drank another tankard of ale before flying up the chimney and onto the roof.",0
"Vasilisa looked out of the window and saw the witch flying away above the trees, but this time she was riding what looked like a giant mortar.",0
"A mortar, by the way, is like a strong wooden bowl, and you can use it for cooking.",0
"You put some herbs or spices in there, and crush and grind them with a stick called a pestle.",0
This is what the witch was flying in – only it was much bigger than a usual mortar.,0
"A giant pestle was what the old lady was holding in her hand, and using as a rudder to guide her flight.",0
"Vasilisa gazed at the witch until she was out of site, and then she started to clean and to cook.",0
"She managed to get everything spick and span, and get the soup on the cooker by midday, but now she faced an impossible task.",0
How could she possibly pick the black peas out of a sack of white ones?,0
"Why, there must have been thousands, if not millions of peas in the sack.",0
She heard a noise outside the hut.,0
"Oh, Baba Yaga must be back early.",1
Now I’m done for!,1
"She exclaimed – but when she looked out of the window she saw not Baba Yaga, but the white horseman who had over-taken her on her way to the hut.",0
He galloped around the fence of the compound and then was off again into the woods.,0
"Vasilisa sighed and wished that he would only come and rescue her, whoever he might be.",0
Then when she turned around from the window she saw that all the peas had been sorted into two piles – one black and one white.,0
Her task was done.,0
"That evening, after Baba Yaga flew back home from whatever business she had been on, the old witch could not hide her surprise at all that her guest had managed to achieve the task in one day.",0
"I see that you are good little worker my dear,",1
she said.,0
"Well in that case, tomorrow you can make pea soup and fetch water from the stream to fill up the tank.",1
"Here, use this bucket.",1
"What she handed to Vasilisa was not a bucket, but a sieve, and the poor girl wondered how she would ever manage to use it to fetch water.",0
"Still that night, when the little rag doll urged her not to feel despair, she knew in her heart that something wonderful might happen to help her – and it did.",0
"For as she stood by the stream holding the sieve in her hand, the red horseman rode by, took it from her and swept over to the hut where he hurled it through the open window.",0
When Vasilisa returned she found that the tank was filled with fresh water.,0
That evening Baba Yaga dipped her bony finger in the tank and tasted a drop of the fresh water.,0
"She said,",0
Indeed you are a hard working girl.,1
Let’s see if you are clever too.,1
Tonight you can stay up and count the number of stars in the sky.,1
"If you tell me the right number in the morning, you can take your light and go free, but if your answer is wrong, even if you tell me one star too many or too few, then I shall have you for my breakfast.",1
"That night Vasilisa gazed out of the window at the sky and tried to count the stars – one,two,three, five...",0
"But by the time she reached one hundred stars she was no longer sure whether or not she was counting the same ones again, and she had to start all over again.",0
It did not help that the hut kept moving around so that the view kept on changing.,0
"Eventually, Vasilisa began to sob quietly.",0
She took out her doll and said:,0
"Oh dear little doll, who will come to the aid of poor little Vasilisa this time?",1
"I cannot guess the number of stars in the sky, and in the morning the witch shall surely eat me.",1
Do not worry said the doll.,1
"Have courage and keep faith, and all will be well.",1
"And it was – for at the midnight hour, the black horseman came riding up to the window where Vasilisa was sitting and he whisper a number to her as if in a dream.",0
"It was a very big number, but I cannot tell you what it was, for it is a secret, but it was the exact number of stars in the sky that he told her, and in the morning, when Baba Yaga stepped with her bony legs onto the floor, Vasilisa said:",0
"Good morning Babushka, shall I tell you the number of stars now?",1
Baba Yaga yawned and said:,0
"Go on child, tell me.",1
"But you had better not be wrong – for if you are, I shall eat you.",1
"Vasilisa told the number to Baba Yaga, who let out a terrible cry like:",0
Her eyes blazed like those of the skulls on the fence surrounding her hut.,0
Who told you that?,1
She demanded so fiercely that Vasilisa sank back.,0
Baba Yaga picked up a plate and threw it across the room so that it smashed against the wall.,0
Then she picked up a knife and Vasilisa was sure she meant to kill her.,0
"But Babushka,",1
she said.,0
You promised that if I told you the number correctly I could take a light and go free.,1
"Baba Yaga froze for a moment, and the fierce glare of her eyes lessened somewhat.",0
"Ah yes,",1
she said more calmly.,0
So I did.,1
I suppose it was morning and day that helped you with the other tasks I set you?,1
"Vasilisa nodded, for she now understood that the three horsemen were morning day and night.",0
"Then you are a good girl,",1
said Baba Yaga.,0
"For if Morning, Day and Night choose to help you, that means that your spirit is in harmony with the universe.",1
I will do you no harm.,1
Wait here while I go on my business.,1
I have no tasks for you today.,1
Tonight you shall return home with a light.,1
"That evening, after Baba Yaga flew home on her mortar, she took Vasilisa out into the courtyard and gave her one of the skulls with blazing eyes.",0
"Take this,",1
she said.,0
It will light up your stepmother and your two stepsisters very well.,1
Vasilisa took the skull and returned back down the path to her village.,0
"She expected that her stepmother would have found a light by now, but in fact the house was not lit.",0
Instead her relatives were sitting in complete darkness.,0
She stepped into the house.,0
The skull lit up the inside as bright as day.,0
"I’m home,",1
"called out Vasilisa. But she received no reply, for as soon as the light fell on her stepmother and sisters, they turned to dust.",0
Vasilisa went to live with a kindly old lady in the village until her father returned from his business.,0
"When he came back, he thought that his wife and stepdaughters must have run away.",0
He did not miss them much.,0
"He lived happily with his beautiful daughter, Vasilisa, until one day a prince came riding by and caught sight of her.",0
"She was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, and he had no hesitation in asking her to marry him, which she did, and they lived happily ever after.",0
The chiX have to get up at sixam every morning to practice.,0
"They are becoming tired and grumpy, and Laura has a new influence in her life.",0
It's becoming hard to hold the band together .,0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Picture by Tania. The day after their first concert, the girls were in a much better mood.",0
"As they were going on the bus to the shopping centre, Laura commented:",0
I think we were alright really.,1
"Not bad for our first gig,",1
"agreed Sam. Gladys felt cross, because the girls hadn’t been saying that the night before.",0
Then they had claimed that it had been a disaster and it was all her fault.,0
Mandy saw her frown.,0
Cheer up Gladdy. We’re sorry we gave you the grots yesterday.,1
You did a great job.,1
"Yeah, we were just stressed out with ourselves really,",1
"added Laura,",0
because we set such high standards for the chiX. We only want to give the public our best.,1
And Gladys felt better because she wanted the chiX to give their best too.,0
"In fact, when they arrived at the shopping centre, the girls were feeling much happier, as if they already had a light sprinkling of stardust.",0
They treated themselves to posh ice creams in tubs.,0
"They sat on a bench to eat them, and a couple of guys came along with ice creams too, and sat nearby.",0
They both wore mod haircuts with long sideburns.,0
Mandy whispered:,0
"Hey, didn’t we meet those dudes at Em’s Party last week?",1
"Laura nodded, because they had.",0
One of them came over and said:,0
Hello again.,0
Remember us?,0
"I know this is a bit sudden like, but I’ve got two tickets to see The Snouts tonight.",0
My friend here is otherwise engaged.,0
"I wondered if one of you girls would do me the honour?"" Sam said:",0
"Sure I’ll come with you,",1
"but his eyes were looking out from under his fringe straight at Laura. She checked her mobile phone, as if she hadn’t heard him, before saying:",0
"Alright, but I’m only coming for the music.",1
We’re musicians you see.,1
I’ve got a professional interest.,1
"Alright,",1
he said.,0
And they agreed to meet that evening.,0
"The next day Laura said the concert was great and that the chiX could learn a lot from The Snouts. On Monday, the chiX's manager, Arny, called up Gladys and said that the girls had made a good start, but the hard work was only beginning.",0
"They needed to build up an act with more songs in it, and to do as many gigs as possible to get",0
broken in.,1
"As the chiX were back at school, they had to get up at six in the morning for rehearsals.",0
The last time they had seen such an early hour was when they were flying to Ibiza – and then they got to the airport late and missed the plane.,0
"Gladys sat up late writing songs, and then woke up early to get the girls out of bed.",0
It was a very tired and grumpy girl band that met the backing musicians at seven.thirty in the rehearsal room.,0
By the end of the week they were able to dance and sing to two new songs almost without thinking.,0
But their mood was terrible.,0
On Saturday Laura went shopping on her own.,0
When she came back she showed the girls her new outfit.,0
She had bought new skinny jeans and an off the shoulder t-shirt with a large hipster belt.,0
"Corr, check out the indie chick,",1
said Sam.,0
"Well if the chiX are serious we can’t go around looking like a bunch of chavs,",1
said Laura.,0
We need style.,1
And that night she went out to another concert with the same guy as before.,0
"His name was Ming. The following Monday, when Gladys tried to wake up the girls, they went on strike and refused to get up.",0
Gladys had to ring Arny and apologise.,0
On Wednesday Gladys felt much better but Laura still looked tired at the rehearsal.,0
Then Gladys realised that she had changed her make-up and had a dark smoky eyeliner look.,0
She had also tasselled her hair.,0
The girls read Gladys’ new song.,0
"Normally they didn’t comment much, but this time Laura said:",0
I don’t think we should be doing this girly kind of stuff Gladdy.,1
Gladys asked her what she meant.,0
"Well I mean, this girl band thing is a kind of naff.",1
Can’t you come up with something original and different?,1
You mean to impress Ming?,1
asked Gladys.,0
What’s Ming got to do with anything?,1
"I mean like, we want people to take us seriously, don’t we?",1
We don’t want to be another fizzy pop and bubble gum group do we?,1
"Like, the chiX are better than that, aren’t they?",1
Gladys felt totally frustrated.,0
"She looked around the room at the empty tea mugs, the electric cables strewn all over the floor, and the bored looking backing musicians.",0
She thought that she should be just getting up out of bed and cleaning her teeth at this time.,0
She recalled that she was behind with her school project.,0
She hadn’t had time to read a book for weeks.,0
She wondered if it was all worthwhile.,0
Mandy said:,0
Come on.,1
It’s a bit early for a heavy discussion.,1
And Sam said:,0
I thought we were a girl band.,1
And Gladys said:,0
Exactly. Don’t try to be something you’re not.,1
"Well you’re not a true artist,",1
said Laura. And she picked up her bag and stomped towards the door of the rehearsal room.,0
Before going out she turned round and said:,0
"In case you haven’t realised yet, I quit!",1
And she slammed the door.,0
The girls were stunned.,0
The backing musicians were smirking.,0
Eventually Gladys said:,0
We’ll talk her round.,1
"Come on, let’s go through the song.",1
"And they did their best, but it wasn’t the same without Laura. They forgot all about the journalist.",0
They didn’t know that he had met Laura in the corridor.,0
They only knew about the article the following Monday when Arny rang Gladys and asked:,0
"""What’s all this nonsense about the chiX splitting?",0
I have left the chiX after creative differences with my younger sister Gladys. It was fun while it lasted.,1
Now I just want to get on with my solo career.,1
Are you cross?,1
asked Gladys.,0
"Not really,",1
said Arny.,0
All publicity is good publicity.,1
A short piece at the bottom of Page twenty-five is not bad for a band that’s only done one gig.,1
"Now get Laura back in the band, and we’ll start all over next week.",1
"And Gladys thought that might work well in the tabloids, but even in reality, would Laura come back?",0
And did she want her to?,0
Download the audio Have you ever seen a very old chest;,0
"black with age, and covered with outlandish carved ornaments and curling leaves?",0
"Well, in a certain parlour there was just such a chest, handed down from some great-grandmother.",0
"Carved all up and down it ran tulips and roses, odd-looking flourishes, and from fanciful thickets little stags stuck out their antlered heads.",0
Right in the middle of the chest a whole man was carved.,0
"He would make you laugh to look at him grinning away, though one couldn’t call his grinning laughing.",0
"He had hind legs like a goat’s, a little horn on his forehead, and a long beard.",0
All his children called him,0
General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs.,1
"It was a difficult name to pronounce and not many people get to be called by it, but he must have been very important or why should anyone have taken trouble to carve him at all?",0
"However, there he stood, forever eyeing a delightful little china shepherdess on the table top under the mirror.",0
"The little shepherdess wore golden shoes, and looped up her gown fetchingly with a red rose.",0
"Her hat was gold, and even her crook was gold.",0
She was simply charming!,0
"Close by her stood a little chimney-sweep, as black as coal, but made of porcelain too.",0
"He was as clean and tidy as anyone can be, because you see he was only an ornamental chimney-sweep.",0
"If the china-makers had wanted to, they could just as easily have turned him out as a prince, for he had a jaunty way of holding his ladder, and his cheeks were as pink as a girl’s.",0
"That was a mistake, don’t you think?",0
He should have been dabbed with a pinch or two of soot.,0
He and the shepherdess stood quite close together.,0
"They had both been put on the table where they stood and, having been placed there, they had become engaged because they suited each other exactly.",0
"Both were young, both were made of the same porcelain, and neither could stand a shock.",0
"Near them stood another figure, three times as big as they were.",0
It was an old China-man who could nod his head.,0
"He too was made of porcelain, and he said he was the little shepherdess’ grandfather - but he couldn’t prove it.",0
"Nevertheless he claimed that this gave him authority over her, and when General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs asked for her hand in marriage, the old China-man nodded consent.",0
There’s a husband for you!,1
The old China-man told the shepherdess.,0
"A husband who, I am inclined to believe, is made of mahogany.",1
"He can make you Mrs. General-Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs. He has the whole chest full of silver, and who knows what else he’s got hidden away in his secret drawers?",1
"But I don’t want to go and live in the dark chest,",1
said the little shepherdess.,0
I have heard people say he’s got eleven china wives in there already.,1
"Then you will make twelve,",1
said the China-man.,0
"Tonight, as soon as the old chest commences to creak I’ll marry you off to him, as sure as I’m a China-man.",1
Then he nodded off to sleep.,0
"The little shepherdess cried and looked at her true love, the porcelain chimney-sweep.",0
"Please let’s run away into the big, wide world,",1
"she begged him,",0
for we can’t stay here.,1
"I’ll do just what you want me to,",1
the little chimney-sweep told her.,0
Let’s run away right now.,1
I feel sure I can support you by chimney-sweeping.,1
"I wish we were safely down off this table,",1
she said.,0
"I’ll never be happy until we are out in the big, wide world.",1
"He told her not to worry, and showed her how to drop her little feet over the table edge, and how to step from one gilded leaf to another down the carved leg of the table.",0
"He set up his ladder to help her, and down they came safely to the floor.",0
But when they glanced at the old chest they saw a great commotion.,0
"All the carved stags were craning their necks, tossing their antlers, and turning their heads.",0
"General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs jumped high in the air, and shouted to the old China-man,",0
They’re running away!,1
They’re running away!,1
This frightened them so that they jumped quickly into a drawer of the window seat.,0
"Here they found three or four decks of cards, not quite complete, and a little puppet theatre, which was set up as well as it was possible to do.",0
"A play was in progress, and all the diamond queens, heart queens, club queens, and spade queens sat in front row and fanned themselves with the tulips they held in their hands.",0
"Behind them the knaves lined up, showing that they had heads both at the top and at the bottom, as face cards do have.",0
"The play was all about two people, who were not allowed to marry, and it made the shepherdess cry because it was so like her own story.",0
"I can’t bear to see any more,",1
she said.,0
I must get out of this drawer at once.,1
"But when they got back to the floor and looked up at the table, they saw the old China-man was wide awake now.",0
"Not only his head, but his whole body rocked forward.",0
"The lower part of his body was one solid piece, you see.",0
The old China-man’s coming!,1
"Cried the little Shepherdess, who was so upset that she fell down on her porcelain knees.",0
"I have an idea,",1
said the chimney-sweeper.,0
We’ll hide in the pot-pourri vase in the corner.,1
"There we can rest upon rose petals and lavender, and when he finds us we can throw salt in his eyes.",1
"It’s no use,",1
she said.,0
"Besides, I know the pot-pourri vase was once the old China-man’s sweetheart, and where there used to be love a little affection is sure to remain.",1
"No, there’s nothing for us to do but to run away into the big wide world.",1
Are you really so brave that you’d go into the wide world with me?,1
Asked the chimney-sweep.,0
"Have you thought about how big it is, and that we can never come back here?",1
"I have,",1
she said.,0
"The chimney-sweep looked her straight in the face and said,",0
My way lies up through the chimney.,1
"Are you really so brave that you’ll come with me into the stove, and crawl through the stovepipe?",1
It will take us to the chimney.,1
"Once we get there, I’ll know what to do.",1
"We shall climb so high that they’ll never catch us, and at the very top there’s an opening into the big wide world.",1
He led her to the stove door.,0
"It looks very black in there,",1
she said.,0
"But she let him lead her through the stove and through the stovepipe, where it was pitch black night.",0
"Now we’ve come to the chimney,",1
he said.,0
And see!,1
See how the bright star shines over our heads.,1
"A real star, high up in the heavens, shone down as if it wished to show them the way.",0
"They clambered and scuffled, for it was hard climbing and terribly steep - way, way up high!",0
"But he lifted her up, held her safe, and found the best places for her little porcelain feet.",0
"At last they reached the top of the chimney, where they sat down.",0
"For they were so tired, and no wonder!",0
"Overhead was the starry sky, and spread before them were all the housetops in the town.",0
They looked out on the big wide world.,0
The poor shepherdess had never thought it would be like that.,0
"She flung her little head against the chimney-sweep, and sobbed so many tears that the gilt washed off her sash.",0
"This is too much,",1
she said.,0
I can’t bear it.,1
The wide world is too big.,1
If I only were back on my table under the mirror.,1
"I’ll never be happy until I stand there again, just as before.",1
"I followed you faithfully out into the world, and if you love me the least bit you’ll take me right home.",1
The chimney-sweep tried to persuade her that it wasn’t sensible to go back.,0
"He talked to her about the old China-man, and of General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs, but she sobbed so hard and kissed her chimney-sweep so much that he had to do as she said, though he thought it was the wrong thing to do.",0
"So back down the chimney they climbed with great difficulty, and they crawled through the wretched stovepipe into the dark stove.",0
"Here they listened behind the door, to find out what was happening in the room.",0
"Everything seemed quiet, so they opened the door and - oh, what a pity!",0
"There on the floor lay the China-man, in three pieces.",0
"When he had come running after them, he tumbled off the table and smashed.",0
"His whole back had come off in one piece, and his head had rolled into the corner.",0
"General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs was standing where he always stood, looking thoughtful.",0
"Oh, dear,",1
"said the little shepherdess,",0
"poor old grandfather is all broken up, and it’s entirely our fault.",1
I shall never live through it.,1
She wrung her delicate hands.,0
"He can be patched,",1
said the chimney-sweep.,0
He can be riveted.,1
Don’t be so upset about him.,1
"A little glue for his back and a strong rivet in his neck, and he will be just as good as new, and just as disagreeable as he was before.",1
"Will he, really?",1
"she asked, as they climbed back to their old place on the table.",0
"Here we are,",1
said the chimney-sweep.,0
Back where we started from.,1
We could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble.,1
"Now if only old grandfather were mended,",1
said the little shepherdess.,0
Is mending terribly expensive?,1
He was mended well enough.,0
"The family had his back glued together, and a strong rivet put through his neck.",0
"That made him as good as new, except that never again could he nod his head.",0
"It seems to me that you have grown haughty since your fall, though I don’t see why you should be proud of it,",1
General Headquarters-Hindquarters-Gives-Orders-Front-and-Rear-Sergeant-Billygoat-Legs complained.,0
"Am I to have her, or am I not?",1
"The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked so pleadingly at the old China-man, for they were deathly afraid he would nod.",0
But he didn’t...,0
He couldn’t.,0
"Neither did he care to tell anyone that, forever and a day, he’d have to wear a rivet in his neck.",0
So the little porcelain people remained together.,0
"They thanked goodness for the rivet in grandfather’s neck, and they kept on loving each other until the day they broke.",0
Story by Bertie. Katie was in the clear.,0
The head teacher knew for a fact that it was somebody else who had been doing all the bad spells around school.,0
But not everybody knew that she was innocent.,0
"In fact, as far as most people were concerned, Katie was still the Number One Suspect. This unpleasant state of affairs became home to Katie when somebody stuck a horrid poster about her on the classroom pin board.",0
"It showed a picture of a witch with a pointed hat and a broom, and beneath the picture was written:",0
"Katie did not notice the poster at first, but then Isabelle said:",0
"Hey Katie, you’re notorious.",1
"Katie wasn’t quite sure if notorious was a good or a bad word, but when she saw the poster she realised that it was definitely bad.",0
She ripped the poster off the wall and tore it up.,0
"Then she saw that Isabelle, Mandy and Judy were smirking at her.",0
Mandy said:,0
Ooh Katie. I put up the poster.,1
Are going to turn me into a toad?,1
And Katie felt ever so tempted to do just that.,0
But she held back because that would be doing Black Magic. And that really would be bad.,0
Katie knew that almost all the girls in her class were gossiping about her.,0
Isis remained her only loyal and true friend.,0
"The boys didn’t seem to care if she was a witch or not, but the boys didn’t talk about anything much anyway, apart from football and action movies.",0
Except for one.,0
And that was Paul. You might think that Paul would be more wary of Katie than most.,0
He had been acting the lead role in the school play that had gone embarrassingly wrong when somebody put a spell on it.,0
"He was good looking, and clever – so Katie thought – and the school play was the first time he had ever been in trouble.",0
"But Paul didn’t seem at all cross with Katie. In fact, he was really nice to her.",0
"For example, on Friday afternoon in the art class, when Katie was painting a black cat, Mandy whispered that it was a witch’s cat.",0
"But Paul said that the eyes in Katie’s painting were just like his own cat’s, and that he really liked his cat because she was mysterious and did her own thing.",0
"Well, Paul likes weird things,",1
said Mandy.,0
"In fact, he likes Katie.",1
"And Judy asked,",0
"Hey Paul, why do you talk to Katie?",1
She put a jinx on your bid for stardom.,1
And the girls sniggered.,0
"And Jemma, who had also been in the play with Paul, and who was still crushingly embarrassed about saying all the wrong lines in front of all the parents and governors – not just any old wrong lines – but really stupid ones – was furious with Katie, and she said:",0
"Look Paul, don’t you ever learn?",1
Stay away from Katie. Witches are bad news.,1
And Paul got really heated and said:,0
All you girls ever do is gossip and whisper nasty things.,1
You don’t know everything.,1
You just think you do.,1
It wasn’t Katie who did those spells.,1
Somebody stole her magic book.,1
"Oh yeah, if you believe that you’ll believe anything,",1
said Jemma. And then they all had to be quiet because Miss Stripes the art teacher was looking at them.,0
"And for the first time in a week, Katie felt really happy.",0
"In fact, she felt especially happy because Paul was sticking up for her.",0
"She knew that Jemma was particularly peeved because she really liked Paul. And that made her feel even more pleased, though perhaps it shouldn’t have done.",0
"In fact, if there was any boy in the class who was ok, it was Paul. He was so nice that he was almost like a girl, only he was a boy.",0
"In fact, he was perfect.",0
But perhaps Paul wasn’t quite as perfect as he used to be.,0
"The next week he was late for school on Monday, and then on Tuesday, and then if he was late on Wednesday, he would be in serious trouble.",0
It was nine.thirty on Wednesday morning.,0
Miss Vile was taking the register.,0
And Paul’s chair was empty.,0
Miss Vile said:,0
Imran – ,0
"Yes, Miss Vile.",1
Jemma,1
"Yes, Miss Vile.",1
Katie,1
"Yes, Miss Vile.",1
And Katie thought:,0
"Shall I, just this once, do just a little spell to help Paul out?",1
"Miss Vile had reached Matthew. Next it would be Nathan and then it would be Paul. Katie wasn’t supposed to do spells at school, but then on the other hand, she really did owe Paul a favour, and she really didn’t want him to be in trouble, because that wouldn’t be fair, because normally he was so good.",0
"Paul,",1
"said Miss Vile. And before the teacher could look up at Paul’s empty chair, Katie quickly said a spell and made it look like he was sitting there and saying:",0
"Yes, Miss Vile,",1
in a voice that sounded almost like his real one.,0
"But just as the magic Paul was answering the register, the real Paul walked into the room.",0
"So if anyone else looked up, the would see two Pauls. And that really could cause double trouble and confusion.",0
Katie quickly said another spell to make the real Paul disappear for a moment while she sorted out the mess.,0
"Fortunately everyone was quite sleepy because it was first thing in the morning, and nobody seemed to notice the strange comings and goings of Paul’s likeness.",0
"Katie was pleased because she had helped Paul, even though he didn’t know that she had – or so she thought.",0
"Just before the first lesson, Paul said:",0
Thanks for helping me out Katie. But there was no need.,1
I don’t want you to get into trouble for doing magic.,1
"And Katie was surprised, because she didn’t think he could see through her magic.",0
"Oh really it was nothing,",1
she said.,0
I owed you.,1
"But Paul kept on getting into more trouble at school, and Katie wasn’t always there to help him.",0
"He forgot his homework, he lost his text books, and pretended to be feeling poorly when the class had to go on a long run around the playing fields when it was raining.",0
"Mr Sadie, the games teacher, didn’t believe him and made him run twice as far as everyone else.",0
"On that occasion, Katie gave Paul just a little help, and said a spell to make him run faster.",0
"Thanks once again,",1
said Paul later on.,0
Thanks for what?,1
asked Katie.,0
Thanks for making me run faster.,1
"And this time Katie asked him how he knew that she had done some magic, because most people wouldn’t have noticed.",0
And Paul let her into a secret.,0
He told her that his grandfather had been a wizard.,0
"But his family were really embarrassed about it, and they hushed up this chapter in the family history and made Paul swear never to do any magic.",0
His mum and dad thought that magic was something you should be ashamed of.,0
"That’s ridiculous,",1
said Katie.,0
"But then, they aren’t the only ones who think like that.",1
There’s a lot of prejudice against witches.,1
People are afraid of us because they don’t understand us.,1
That’s why it’s supposed to be a secret that I’m a witch.,1
"It’s not a very good secret,",1
said Paul.,0
Everyone knows it.,1
And everyone blames me when things go wrong.,1
"Yes, I’ve noticed,",1
"said Paul. Although what Paul had told Katie was a secret, she shared it with Isis because she was her best friend.",0
"And when Isis heard, she said:",0
Now it all makes perfect sense.,1
It was Paul who stole your book.,1
That’s why he’s sticking up for you.,1
He feels guilty that everyone is blaming you for his naughty spells.,1
And at first Katie couldn’t believe that Paul would do something bad like stealing her book.,0
"But then she thought some more, and she had to admit that whoever stole her book seemed to have a talent for magic.",0
"Because it was one thing to read the spells in a book, and it was another to actually do them.",0
In fact it was really only supposed to be witches and wizards who could do them.,0
"It’s obvious,",1
said Isis.,0
You can’t see it because you’ve got a pang for Paul.,1
I have not.,1
"Yes, you have.",1
"Well, perhaps just a bit,",1
"admitted Katie. The next week Paul did something really, really bad.",0
He sneaked out of school at lunchtime and went for a walk around town on his own.,0
And then some rough boys started picking on him.,0
A police car was going by and saw that there was a fight about to happen.,0
They stopped to help Paul and that was how they found out that he was playing truant from school.,0
Now he was in big trouble.,0
Like getting excluded from school kind of trouble.,0
"Miss Hepworth, the head teacher, called his mother in for a chat.",0
"The word was out that Paul was going to get the Big Push. Paul wasn’t in school, but Katie really wanted to talk to him.",0
"She had never been to Paul’s house, and she didn’t have his phone number or email address.",0
But that didn’t stop her.,0
"Her mum had a magic phone that knew everyone’s number in the entire world, even the numbers of people like the Queen, or the President of the United States, or Sir Paul McCartney. Mum never used it to call people like them, because she said they were busy, and in any case, they didn’t need any help or advice from a witch because they had their own kind of magic.",0
"But the phone was incredibly useful when you lost a friend’s number, or didn’t have it in the first place.",0
Katie picked it up and just said:,0
"I’d like to call Paul please,",1
And the phone understood which Paul she meant and it called him right away.,0
Paul’s mum answered and she heard her call up the stairs:,0
Paul. There’s a ,0
Katie,1
on the phone for you.,0
Hello Katie. Or perhaps I should say goodbye.,1
You know they’re going to kick me out of school.,1
"I’m so cross with you,",1
said Katie.,0
Why have you been acting so bad recently?,1
You’ve always been so well behaved.,1
"In fact, up until recently you were Mr Perfect.",1
"Well, I suppose I got bored with being Mr Perfect,",1
said Paul.,0
Being bad seems like more fun.,1
"And besides, I’ve got something to confess.",1
It was me who stole your spell book.,1
"I figured that out for myself already,",1
said Katie.,0
But now I’m going to save you one last time.,1
I’ll do a mind wipe on Mrs Hepworth so that she forgets all the bad things you’ve done.,1
And Paul said something that really surprised Katie:,0
"No don’t do that,",1
he said.,0
I forbid you.,1
I don’t want to be saved by your magic.,1
I’ve got to face this myself.,1
"And although Katie argued with him, and she meant to ignore what he said and do the spell anyway, later that evening she decided to call Isis and ask her advice.",0
"And Isis said that yes, Paul had to take his lesson.",0
It would be good for him.,0
And so Paul was expelled from school.,0
"And before he left, Paul told his friends that it was he who had stolen Katie’s spell book, and people understood at last that Katie really was innocent of doing all the bad spells around school.",0
Katie was really sad that she wouldn’t be seeing Paul at school anymore.,0
But she had one compensation.,0
She did have his telephone number.,0
And now all she had to do was think of a reason to invite him round in the holidays so that her mother could explain to him the difference between good and bad magic.,0
"When Gladys sent an email out to a record exec, a reply usually shot back right away...",1
unfortunately.,1
"Too often, it stated bluntly, ""The address xyz @xyz.com has not been found",1
"She had met loads of movers and shakers when she was young - well actually she still was young - but when she was little she had gone around quite a bit with her singing sisters and she had always asked for business cards, because she was savvy like that, but she had spent the last few years just being a normal school kid.",0
"Her stock of contacts for producers, pluggers and promoters was out of date.",0
She needed to put her song in front the right people.,0
"She worked hard at uploading her mpthree onto all the social music sites, and emailing it directly to recording companies and promoters.",0
"When her emails didn’t bounce, she assumed that they had landed on the right screen.",0
She must have had about half a dozen chances out there.,0
She checked her email first thing in the morning.,0
"Two new messages were waiting for her - one reminding her that she hadn't logged on to a game-site for a while,",0
"Your Pink Tomogo is missing you,",1
it mourned.,0
The other was from her school about the last day of term.,0
Eventually a reply from a record company turned up.,0
"Dear Gladys, Thank you for sending James O’Hara your mpthree.",0
"As I am sure, you realise we receive hundreds of submissions each week, but we do listen to every single one.",0
"If we wish to take this further, we will let you know in due course.",0
"Yours, Mira Simons She read it two or three times.",0
"Well perhaps they will get back,",1
she thought.,0
"Then, a voice in her head said,",0
"Oh Gladys, don’t be so naive, it’s a polite brush-off letter.",1
You’ll never hear from them again.,1
"Back in the day, when the chiX were starting out, she used to work with Arny, their manager.",0
She really missed him now.,0
Arny had been born in the East End of London. His first job was pushing a tea trolley inside the office of a record company.,0
"He ran errands, showed willing, as well as a certain gift of the gab, and got himself promoted to the position of",0
plugger.,1
It was his role to chat up DJs on the radio and persuade them to play the company’s singles.,0
"Soon he was managing the publicity for some of the biggest bands of the seventys, in the days when rock stars had long hair and bad teeth and wore brightly coloured polyester jumpsuits.",0
"Gladys actually knew the names of the some of his clients, because they featured in her dad’s record collection.",0
"Nowadays he was the sort of self-made man who drove a pink Rolls Royce, actually, his was black and totally ancient, but it suited him.",0
"He had always looked after Gladys and treated her like a grown-up, even when she was little.",0
"Looking back, she wasn’t quite sure if he was just kidding her a bit, like grown-ups do with children sometimes...",0
"but no, even with hindsight, she didn’t think he was never less than on the level.",0
He was genuine in his respect for Gladys and her gumption and her brains.,0
But her desire to be a performer - well that was something else.,0
Maybe he did not see her in that role.,0
"Of course, when she had the idea to quit school and be a singer, the first person she called was Arny. The office manager had said,",0
I’m afraid Mr. Blackstone has been taken ill.,1
Oh dear.,1
When will he be back?,1
Asked Gladys.,0
We don’t know.,1
It could be some weeks.,1
That sounded worrying.,0
"Can I, can I ask what’s wrong?",1
I’m Gladys. He knew me quite well when I was little.,1
He’s had a heart attack.,1
"He’s in Kingston Hospital,",1
came the reply.,0
Nobody she knew had been seriously ill before...,0
like in danger of dying...,0
"this was a first in her young life, and quite a shock.",0
Now Gladys felt guilty because she had only visited him in hospital once.,0
"That time he had been quite cheerful, but really did look gaunt.",0
"She had wanted to cry, and did not feel like going back to see him again.",0
"By now, she thought, he must be getting stronger.",0
It might do him good to talk about business.,0
"At any rate, he could give her a word or two of advice.",0
She arrived at Kingston Hospital with chocolates and flowers.,0
"""Ah Gladys, it's like having an angel sitting on the end of my bed,"" said Arny, who still had so many wires plastered to his chest that he looked like an old-fashioned TV set with the back off.",0
She thought that because her dad had one of those in his workshop.,0
"Gladys told him about her decision to leave school, and to try making it as a singer.",0
"She crossed her fingers, really hoping he would not give her the same lecture that everyone else had done.",0
"You know, the one about her being too smart to take a risk like singing for her supper, and that she should get her exams first.",0
Were they passing a script around or something?,0
Arny sat up and rearranged his pillow.,0
"""Well girl, I wish you luck, because the business has got a whole lot tougher over the past few years.",0
It's a lottery.,0
A tiny handful make mega bucks.,0
They rest get squiggly pop.,0
What do they call the lottery?,0
"A tax on the desperate, or the stupid.",0
"You’re neither of those, but you need to know the facts before you start down this road.",0
"Well I left school when I was fifteen, but plenty of those singers who pretend to be from the wrong side of the tracks got good educations.",1
Where was it Mick Jagger went?,1
"London School of Economics, wasn’t it?",1
Anyone more recent than that went to uni?,1
Asked Gladys.,0
"Funnily enough, I was just reading an article about Paloma Faith...",0
it’s on the side table...,0
here it is.,0
"Says she has an MA in theatre direction from the prestigious Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design. Look Gladdy, there are many ways to go in life.",0
Now let me see if I can work the phone for you.,0
" Notices around the hospital warned everyone to keep their mobiles switched off, as they might interfere with the medical equipment, but of course, the real problem for Arny was he couldn't live without his phone.",1
He sneaked it out from under the blankets and called a contact in a big record company:,1
"""Yeah, she's really smart, and she's known the business since she was ten years old,"" he was saying.",1
She could hear the voice coming back that the chiX had faded fast and were yesterday's sound.,1
"Laura's last single had struggled to get into the top forty in the download charts, and the only reason the studio hadn't sacked her was because she was dating Simon Ferg of the Fergs and they didn't want to upset one of their biggest grossing stars.",1
"Yes, it was going to be hard thought Gladys. In a strange way, her connection with the chiX was going to make it harder.",1
Their time had come and gone.,1
Arny was the sort of guy it was hard to say no to.,1
He was charming and persistent.,1
"He wasn’t above using the fact that he had a heart attack, and it would be rotten to refuse him when he was down, and in any case, he had all day and wasn't going to hang up until his friend had put a date in the diary to meet Gladys. In short, Gladys got her first meeting with a record company.",1
Not bad going just two weeks after making her first demo.,1
"As a ten year old, she had been surprisingly cool headed and savvy about business.",1
"In fact, she was the one who sat up late reading her sisters’ first contract and pointing out the loopholes.",1
"But the funny thing was, now she was sixteen, everything was so much harder.",1
The prospect of such an important meeting was starting to freak her out.,1
How should she dress?,1
"Smart for a business, or cool for pop?",1
First impressions are so important in a superficial world.,1
"What she needed to do was to strike an attitude - she knew that much, but however hard she tried, she always looked the swotty schoolgirl.",1
How could she make them see that she was touched by destiny?,1
She decided to dress smartly.,1
She wore a white shirt and dark trousers.,1
She would look like she meant business.,1
Gladys arrived early at the music company’s office.,1
She always liked to be ahead of time.,1
It made her feel on top of things.,1
"The PA showed her into an empty meeting room with a big table, blinds on the windows, and the hum of air conditioning.",1
A jug of water and a plate of biscuits waited on the sideboard.,1
"After forty minutes or so, three executives breezed in, two men and one woman.",1
Cards were tossed across the table.,1
She was shaking their hands.,1
"They seemed to be taking her quite seriously - they were young, but they had impressive titles like Account Manager, A&R Director, and Jnr Director of Marketing. The one who did the most talking was Dave. The woman, Susie, sat back and looked at Gladys in quite a hard, assessing sort of way.",1
"Jude, who was the most chilled of the three, was pleasant.",1
"""Have you brought a demo?"" Asked Mike. ""Ouch!"" Thought Gladys, ""They haven't even heard my track."" Of course she had the song on her phone.",1
"You would think that a meeting room in a music business office would have some sort of sound system she could plug it into - and it did, but there did not appear to be the right connector, even though it was probably the most common one in the world.",1
"Fortunately, her phone had quite a good volume on the speaker.",1
She played,1
"All We Want to do is Sing,",0
"Thank you,",1
but stopped herself.,0
Why should she thank someone for such a patronising put-down?,0
She wasn’t going to fall into that trap.,0
"She wanted to cry, but she was determined not to give them that satisfaction.",0
"""It’s true that you could work on your image,"" said Jude,",0
and of course do lots of gigging to get experience.,1
"Tried and tested, that's what you need to be.",1
"Dave said,",0
I hope we don't sound too mean.,1
"Perhaps if I give you couple of stats about the music biz, you will know where we are coming from.",1
seventy-four per cent of mpthrees in the online stores are downloaded less than ten times.,1
"That's basically sales to mum, dad, a couple of aunts and a best friend.",1
"So quite frankly, almost everything does nothing.",1
"Zilch. On the other hand, sixty per cent of our revenues come from just five big artists with the company.",1
Almost everyone new that we sign loses us money.,1
"So you see, it pays us to keep backing our winners.",1
Signing new talent is a big risk.,1
"""But without new talent, there’s no future,"" said Gladys. ""Correct. So we are very serious about A & R.",0
"Artists and repertoire,",1
"explained Jude. ""It's what I do.",0
I nurture the new talent.,0
"Like Dave says, we really care about the future, but at the end of the day, it’s a business, and we have to back winners or there will be no business, and nobody will benefit if that happens.",0
Not the musicians.,0
Not the fans.,0
Not nobody.,0
"but also they were saying,",0
Don’t even bother trying.,1
"She left the office with tears in her eyes, not of disappointment, but fury.",0
What a patronising bunch of smug jobs-worthies!,1
She thought to herself.,0
It gives them some sort of perverted pleasure to smash risk-takers’ dreams while they claim their safe salaries.,1
"Well, my belief is stronger than that.",1
I’m keeping it in tact.,1
This is our most ambitious story about the,0
Wicked Uncle,1
"– Uncle Jeff. Of course he’s not really wicked, merely irresponsible, and somewhat annoying to Mum and Dad. But the kids love him.",0
We’ve mixed in some educational space background about space travel.,0
"For example, we mention Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and we explain about the astronauts who have to endure g-force as the rocket takes off.",0
Several real life companies are promising holidays in space and there are even plans to build a space hotel.,0
Our description of the hotel and the robot butler is fantasy though.,0
Needless to say none of the characters or businesses mentioned in the story have anything to do with real life ones.,0
"The main aim of this story is try and convey some of the wonder of being in space and looking back at the Earth, and the marvel of creation and life which is so much part of Christmas. Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. It was November. Every shop window glittered with Christmas lights, inflatable Santas, Christmas trees, tinsel and glitz.",0
"Oh no,",1
"said Mum as she pushed the trolley around the supermarket,",0
I’m bored with Christmas already.,1
I’m simply not going to order a turkey this year.,1
We’ll just have to get away for the holidays - as far away as we possibly can.,1
"But she could not quite work out how to win over Dad and the kids to her get-away-plan, because she knew just how much they loved every detail of Christmas at home, right down to the last bad joke in the crackers.",0
She was still brooding over the problem that evening when the phone rang.,0
It was Uncle Jeff. She held the receiver about six inches from her ear because his voice was loud and grating.,0
"Have I got Christmas sorted for you and the kids this year, ",0
" he announced, ",0
"It’s a surprise that’s, well, out of this world.",1
That’s the only way to put it.,1
Like an all-inclusive luxury hotel in the Maldives out-of-this-world?,1
asked Mum hopefully.,0
Not a bad guess.,1
It is a Christmas get-away.,1
"But it’s less boring than a beach,",1
replied Jeff. In fact the news was so exciting that he had to come round and break it to the family in person.,0
"An hour later, the wheels of Jeff’s Porsche crunched onto the drive.",0
Mum felt a certain amount of dread as she wondered what his Christmas surprise would be.,0
"She imagined all the dangerous and irresponsible treats that he might, in his bachelor delusion, believe to be suitable for a family holiday:",0
Big Game Hunting?,0
Scuba Diving with Great White Sharks?,0
Jumping out of helicopters with skis?,0
She watched her husband grimace as Jeff slapped him on the back and asked,0
How’s tricks my older bro?,1
"The kids were supposed to be in bed, but both were sitting in their pyjamas at the top of the stairs.",0
Hi Uncle Jeff!,1
they chorused.,0
"And he gave them a wink and replied,",0
"no listening in now, because what I’m going to say is so exciting that if you hear it, you won’t be able to sleep.",1
So of course they both did listen at the living room door while Jeff unveiled his surprise to Mum and Dad.,0
"I bet,",1
"said Jeremy,",0
that he knows a rock star or some mega famous actor who’s invited us to stay in a mansion.,1
"I’m not so sure about that,",1
said Jemima.,0
I think Jeff knows business people mainly.,1
Mum says he drives around in sports cars because most of his life is really rather boring.,1
"And when they both reapplied their ears to the door they heard that Uncle Jeff was indeed talking about a business person, but not a boring one:",0
"Back in the summer, when you came to stay at my place by the sea, there was a big yacht in the harbour belonging to a mega-rich Russian. Me and the kids ran into him by chance, and there was a little, shall we say, unpleasantness with his staff, for which he was incredibly sorry.",1
"And by way of apology, he wants the family – that’s you and the kids – to be the first to try out his life-changing – first of its kind, new frontier -travel service, all absolutely free, gratis, on the house.",1
It will be the holiday of a lifetime.,1
And what sort of holiday would that be?,1
asked Dad.,0
The name of the company is a bit of a giveaway.,0
It’s called ,0
Holidays in Space.,1
"I don’t get it,",1
said Mum.,0
"Well,",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
It does what it says in the tin.,1
Here’s some literature.,1
And he handed them some brochures.,0
"I still don’t get it,",1
said Mum.,0
What do all these pictures of space rockets mean?,1
exclaimed Jeremy outside the door.,0
It’s pretty obvious isn’t it?,1
"We’re going to spend Christmas in space, courtesy of Uncle Jeff and his Russian billionaire friend.",1
"Don’t be silly and keep your voice down,",1
hissed back his sister.,0
"They could hear that Mum was saying,",0
Oh no!,1
Oh no!,1
Oh no!,1
And Jeremy pushed the door open and came flying into the room saying,0
"Yes, yes yes!",1
Thank you Uncle Jeff!,1
That’s the most incredible idea ever!,1
And Jemima was saying,0
Not me.,1
You won’t catch me going up in rocket propelled bucket!,1
Dad just sat looking amazed.,0
Mum was pleading with him.,0
"Explain to your brother why his idea is completely no-can-do, not-on-your-life.",1
But Dad got up and hugged his brother.,0
"You see,",1
"he said,",0
"when we were both growing up, we both wanted to be astronauts.",0
And now Jeff has made it possible.,0
That’s so incredibly kind of him.,0
Of course we must accept.,0
Don’t you see?,0
This is an amazing opportunity for the kids.,0
It will change their whole view of the world.,0
"You wouldn’t want them to grow up saying that they had a chance to go into space, but their parents passed it by?",0
" And when Mum thought about it, she realised that she wouldn’t want her children saying a thing like that.",0
"As soon as the school term finished, the family flew to Russia to begin training for their Christmas holiday.",0
"Three and a half hours after leaving London, they landed at Moscow airport.",0
"As they came through passport control , surly looking men in leather jackets called out ",0
taxi!,1
taxi!,1
"Nyet, Nyet,",1
said Mum. It was the only Russian she knew.,0
It means,0
"There’s our guide,",1
said Dad. And he tugged his suitcase on wheels in the direction of a tall blonde lady who was holding up a sign that said:,0
HOLIDAYS IN SPACE.,1
"A car picked them up outside the airport and drove them along the ring road around Moscow. They looked out at the landscape of snow covered fields, silver birch trees, high-rised flats and signs in unfamiliar Russian letters – and quite frankly they felt that they were already out of this world.",0
"Finally they checked into their hotel inside Star City, the training centre for all the Russian cosmonauts, as well as for space tourists like themselves.",0
"The rooms were rather small and poky, and Dad said it was part of the training, to get used to the cramped conditions of the space craft...",0
"A little later, the family went downstairs to meet Uncle Jeff who had been in Moscow for a few days already:",0
Hey Kids. Welcome to Space City. Have you seen Yuri Gagarin yet?,1
Who’s he?,1
asked Jeremy.,0
Why he’s my hero.,1
"The first man in space of course,",1
said Jeff.,0
"Get your gloves and hats on, and we’ll go and pay homage.",1
He’s just across the square.,1
"Yuri Gagarin was in fact a statue on the steps of the space museum – a sliver man flying through a hoop, more like a circus acrobat than a cosmonaut.",0
"As Uncle Jeff explained, the real Yuri Gagarin had died when he crashed his Mig fighter jet.",0
"But he got into space first, in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one, ahead of the Americans,",1
he added.,0
"But the Americans got to the moon first,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"That’s true, I well remember watching the Apollo moon mission on a dim television screen when we were boys.",1
The rocket standing on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral. Mission control counting down.,1
And then a blast of fire.,1
"Lift off from zero to twenty-eight,zero kilometers per hour, why that’s a bigger rush than my motorcycle can do!",1
"Ever since then, I’ve dreamed of a trip through space.",1
And now your dream is coming true Uncle Jeff,1
said Jemima.,0
Uh-uh.,1
No room for me.,1
It’s going to be squished getting you four inside the space shuttle.,1
And the kids realised just how generous Uncle Jeff had been to give up his chance of fulfilling his boyhood dream for them.,0
"Mum would have gladly given him her place in space, but she knew she would be more worried waiting on the ground than if she was actually in orbit with the family.",0
We’re going to be the first family in space..,1
"It will be like, historic.",1
said Jeremy.,0
"And great publicity for the travel company,",1
said Dad.,0
"Providing we all get back safely,",1
added mum.,0
"In the morning, things started to get even more real when they met their space instructor, a former cosmonaut called Timor who had spent six months living in the International Space Station which orbits the Earth. He told the kids:",0
"When I was in space, I missed my family.",1
There was nothing else on Earth that I felt the need for.,1
So you are very fortunate to be going up with your Mom and Dad.,1
Jemima hugged her mother and said how wonderful it was to be going into space together.,0
Jeremy shuffled his feet.,0
Timor took them to the quartermaster to try on their space suits for the first time.,0
All the suits had,0
Holidays in Space,1
written across the chests and helmets.,0
"Jeremy had a blue helmet and Jemima had a pink one, Dad had an extra large helmet, and Mum had a neat white one.",0
Uncle Jeff joined them for their training too – just so he could get a taste of what space travel would be like.,0
"He brought his own space helmet which he had ordered especially from NASA, the American space agency.",0
It bore the inscription:,0
Buzz Lightyear. Space Ranger. Mum said it only went to show that Uncle Jeff hadn’t grown up.,0
Their first space lesson was fun.,0
"It involved picking up toothbrushes while wearing big fat gloves, and sticking things to walls with velcro, because in space everything would be floating around.",0
"Then they learnt to operate the space toilet, which was a cross between a seat and a vacuum cleaner and had lots of different coloured buttons.",0
The next day things started to get tough.,0
"The hardest part of space travel is enduring the enormously powerful gravitational force – or g-force – when you pass out of, and then back into, the Earth’s Atmosphere. This force feels a bit like being on the biggest, fastest, scariest, and most sick-making fair ground ride – and so space training is a bit like going to the fun fair – only a lot worse.",0
They met Timor in a large empty room next to the gymnasium.,0
"Jeremy. Please sit on this chair and fasten the seat belt nice and tight,",1
said Timor. Jeremy did as he was told.,0
The chair wasn’t particularly comfortable.,0
He wondered what was going to happen.,0
Was he about to drop through a trap door?,0
Or shoot up through the ceiling at vast speed?,0
No. Wrong on both counts.,0
"He started to spin round, fast at first, and then even faster, then even faster.",0
"It would have been fine, only he felt that his stomach and his head were both travelling at different speeds in different directions.",0
He wished he had not eaten pancakes and honey for breakfast.,0
STOP!,1
he shouted.,0
"He span round a few dozen more times, but now more and more slowly, thankfully.",0
Well done.,1
You lasted ninety-six seconds before begging for mercy.,1
Not bad.,1
said Timor. Jeremy felt too sick to make any comment.,0
"And then Jemima, Mum and Dad all had a go.",0
Mum lasted the longest – two and a half minutes – perhaps that was because she had eaten the least breakfast.,0
"Over the next couple of weeks, they did a lot of whizzing around in circles.",0
"And trained inside a giant water tank, to get used to floating, because that’s what you do in space.",0
"At the end of their training, Timor presented each member of the family with a certificate that said:",0
"And the next day they flew to the desert of Kazakhstan which, although it is a long way south of Moscow, is still cold and snowy in winter.",0
Jeremy and Jemima looked out of their hotel window towards the brand new space shuttle that stood on the launch pad pointing straight up to the grey clouds.,0
"It was the first of its kind, the jumbo-jet of space craft, especially designed to carry tourists out of the world’s atmosphere.",0
The words,0
Holidays in Space,1
were written in English and Russian letters down its sides.,0
Jemima said.,0
I wish they hadn’t given us a room overlooking that thing.,1
It makes me want to go home.,1
And Jeremy said:,0
I’m scared too.,1
But we’ve got no choice.,1
Dad’s determined to go.,1
Upstairs Mum and Dad were also looking out of the window towards the shuttle.,0
Dad was saying:,0
It’s funny.,1
I dreamt of this all my life.,1
"And now I see that space craft on the runway, I’m wondering, should I be taking this risk with the kids?",1
And Mum said:,0
We can’t pull out now.,1
It would be too embarrassing.,1
"And on the top floor, Jeff was looking out at the spaceship, and saying to himself.",0
"Oh, oh my....",1
I hope that contraption is space-worthy and totally safe.,1
"If anything happens to them, I’ll never forgive myself.",1
"Just after dawn, a battered old bus took the family over the slushy runway to the shuttle.",0
They wore their space suits and carried their helmets under their arms.,0
"Underneath their spacesuits they wore woolly vests and long johns, because it’s cold in space.",0
"And underneath those, they wore special diapers or nappies for space travellers because – well I won’t explain that – but let’s just say they had a long flight ahead before they reached the space hotel.",0
Uncle Jeff was waiting for them next to the steps up into the shuttle.,0
"He hugged each of his relatives in turn, giving his brother the last and longest hug:",0
"Hey kiddo,",1
he said.,0
May the force be with you!,1
"Sergei, the space travel tycoon, was there too.",0
They all got a kiss on both cheeks from the billionaire.,0
Apparently that was a Russian tradition.,0
"The three crew members were the first to climb up the ladder to the door of the space craft, and the family followed.",0
"Jemima was last up, and she turned and waved to the television cameras and gave them a happy smile.",0
"Inside, the space tourists lay down on their seats with their knees bent towards them, as they had been taught.",0
The illuminated signs above their positions read:,0
Fasten Seat Belts. Switch off Mobile Phones. No smoking.,1
They slotted their safety buckles into place.,0
"Jeremy looked at Jemima, and Jemima looked at Jeremy. Inside their helmets they could hear the chattering of voices from Mission Control, but they couldn’t understand a word because it was all in Russian. Jeremy and Jemima could talk to each other over the radio, but they had to compete with the background babble which was quite confusing.",0
Jeremy said:,0
Jeremy to Jemima. Thanks for being a good sister.,1
"I mean, if this space- doohickey blows up or something, I want you to know that you were okay really.",1
"Jemima to Jeremy,",1
replied his sister.,0
It’s not going to blow up.,1
But thanks for being a good brother – most of the time.,1
The Countdown was in Russian and English. At the end of the countdown there was stillness.,0
The chattering in their ears ceased.,0
It was like the whole world had stopped turning.,0
And then the rocket blasters pushed off.,0
They were travelling at five miles a second straight up.,0
They all felt their stomachs go heave-ho.,0
I’m not going to be sick.,1
"I’m not going to be sick,",1
said Jeremy. And he was glad that he hadn’t eaten pancakes for breakfast.,0
"The ship shook and shuddered so much that Jeremy could hear his bones rattling – in fact the Wright brothers probably enjoyed a smoother flight when they took off in the first airplane in one thousand, nine hundred and three.",0
"The view through the window turned grey with cloud but soon the view became blue, then purple, and at last black.",0
It had taken them six minutes to reach space.,0
The rockets stopped firing.,0
The ship stopped shaking.,0
There was silence.,0
"A deep, awesome, silence.",0
Jeremy was the first to see that the seatbelt sign had been turned off.,0
"He pressed the red button to release himself, and he cart-wheeled out of his seat.",0
"He flew straight into the wall, but it didn’t matter because it was covered with soft padding.",0
Dad followed him.,0
They were both floating in total weightlessness.,0
And then the oxygen sign came on which meant they could take their helmets off.,0
Wow this amazing,1
"exclaimed Jeremy as Jemima shot past him, flaying her arms around like a baby sea gull learning to fly.",0
Mum was floating on her back like she was resting on the warm calm sea that she had dreamt of for her holiday.,0
"I think,",1
"said Mum,",0
that a baby must feel like this inside the mother’s womb.,1
The most remarkable part was yet to come.,0
Hey look at this!,0
 called Jemima. She was pressing her face against one of the portholes.,0
She was looking at the top of the world.,0
A translucent blue curve.,0
"And beyond it, all infinity.",0
"They were all quiet, lost for words, until Jeremy said:",0
"Hey, look there’s Santa.",1
Where?,1
asked Jemima. ,0
Caught you....,1
just kidding.,1
"And then they were silent again for a while, until Dad said:",0
You wouldn’t think there were any problems down there.,1
Like Mr. Jones is late for work and Johnny’s stuck on his home work.,1
And the whole family knew that they would always have a special bond.,0
"Not just because they were family, but because they had shared this experience together, and had seen Planet Earth from the outside, and felt the harmony of the Universe. The journey took another two days before they caught up with the space hotel in its orbit around Earth. Their shuttle docked with the larger ship on Christmas Eve. The family floated into their hotel through connecting hatches.",0
There was music playing in the reception area.,0
It was Jingle Bells. The butler was a robot called Fred who wore a Santa Claus hat.,0
He introduced them to the luxuries of their new home.,0
"Their floating sleeping bags were more comfortable than the best mattresses, and they would sleep like birds on the wing.",0
The water in the shower floated upwards.,0
"The space toilet was a slightly different model from the one which they had trained on, but if they got confused they could consult the instruction manual.",0
"The refrigerator had every type of drink, but it didn’t matter if they wanted water or champaign, they still had to drink it through a straw.",0
"They should use the rowing machine every day, because your muscles can go flabby in space if you aren’t careful.",0
"For a special relaxation, the butler could give them a foot massage, or they could climb into the aromatherapy capsule.",0
"They could use the free wifi to check their emails, cruise the net or even watch tv.",0
"But actually, the coolest thing you could do was to look out of the big window to stare into infinite space.",0
Dad asked Fred to move the Christmas tree because it was blocking part of the view.,0
"For Christmas lunch, they strapped themselves to the table so that they wouldn’t float up to the ceiling.",0
Fred brought round the Turkey sandwiches and the Christmas pudding.,0
They pulled Christmas crackers and read jokes like:,0
"I only work when I’m fired, what am I?",0
A rocket.,0
What kind of astronaut can jump higher than a house?,0
Any kind.,0
A house can’t jump.,0
And they laughed even more than they would have done at home.,0
And then they went up to the bridge to look out at the blue planet called Earth.,0
Isn’t it just like a new born baby?,1
said Mum.,0
"It’s so beautiful, so perfect, so fragile.",1
It’s a miracle.,1
And Dad said :,0
Happy Christmas Darling,1
and he kissed Mum. And Jemima said:,0
I wish we could take something back for Uncle Jeff. Like a piece of moon rock or something.,1
"And they all remembered how their Wicked Uncle had given them this amazing Christmas present, and Mum admitted:",0
"For the first time ever, I’m truly sorry that Jeff isn’t with us.",1
It was so kind of him to give up his place on the shuttle for us.,1
Their watches were still set to Greenwich Mean Time. Dad noticed that it was almost three o’clock in London.,0
Come on,1
he said.,0
We can’t miss the Queen just because we’re two hundred and eighty miles above the Buckingham Palace. Let’s fire up the internet.,1
"A few minutes later, they were all gathered around a screen watching the Queen, just as they watched her at home every Christmas Day. Her Majesty wore reading spectacles and said:",0
"At this time of peace and goodwill, our thoughts turn to children all over the world.",1
"Hey, and don’t forget us kids up here in space!",1
"said Jeremy. When the Queen had finished her Christmas message, Dad wanted to take",0
a quick snoop at the headlines.,1
And he picked up the keyboard and switched the screen over to Google News.,0
I wouldn’t bother.,1
"Nothing ever happens at Christmas,",1
advised Mum.,0
"You’re right,",1
said Dad.,0
It all looks reassuringly boring down there....,0
but that’s funny.,0
There’s a news story here that says ,0
Family Stuck in Space,1
Is there another family up here?,0
"Here let me see that,",1
exclaimed Mum in a panicky voice.,0
"The news story – and the four thousand and thirty-two other similar stories on Google News – was about the Crusoe family from Walton Upon Thames, England. There was only one Crusoe family in orbit around the Earth that Christmas. And they were that family.",0
Mum read on.,0
The Crusoe Family may be spending rather longer in space than they bargained for.,0
The shuttle that was due to bring them back to Earth has failed safety tests.,0
Inspectors from the International Federation for Space Travel declared it unsafe to fly after a cleaner noticed that a vital life support system had been fastened to the outside of the craft with masking tape.,0
"A spokesman for the Russian Travel company, Holidays in Space, said:",0
"The Crusoes have enough dried food, water and oxygen to last them another year in orbit.",1
"Even if they are celebrating next year’s Christmas in space, they will be OK.",1
"Mr. Crusoe’s brother, Jeff Crusoe, who is currently in Moscow, said:",0
I am working night and day to get the family back down to Earth where they belong.,1
When she had finished reading the article Mum said:,0
I should have trusted my first instinct.,0
As soon as Jeff said he had got Christmas ,0
sorted,1
I felt something terrible was going to happen.,0
But I allowed your brother to sweet talk me into this insane space escapade.,0
Next Christmas....,1
said Jeremy.,0
That seems like an awfully long time before we get back home.,1
"If we ever get down at all,",1
"said Jemima, who looked more shocked than any of them.",0
Mum inspected the larder.,0
"She found powdered strawberry mousse, powdered milk, powdered chicken broth, powdered lamb curry, and powdered just about any food you could think of.",0
"It’s back to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys,",1
said Dad.,0
That’s what Jeff and I lived on when we were growing up.,1
"Don’t talk to me about Jeff,",1
said Mum. The week between Christmas and New year passed quietly.,0
Jemima drew maps of the constellations.,0
Jeremy played computer games.,0
"Dad practiced virtual reality golf swings, and Mum read War and Peace, which she had always wanted to do, but had never found the time.",0
In fact it would have been a deeply relaxing holiday – if it wasn’t for the fact that they all knew that they were Stuck in Space. The news did not improve.,0
Holiday Space Company Tottering on the Brink...,1
read Dad on the internet.,0
The millionaires who had booked holidays in the space hotel were cancelling one after the other.,0
The company was in danger of going bankrupt.,0
"And if that happened, the Crusoe Family might be stuck in space FOREVER!",0
"We’ll have to get down to Earth sooner than that,",1
said Mum.,0
Because I’ve sworn a solemn oath to smack your Uncle Jeff around the chops.,1
"What was he thinking of, sending us up here?",1
"He’s the most irresponsible uncle in the entire world, sorry, in the entire Universe",1
"she said with a gesture towards the Universe itself, stretched out just beyond the window.",0
And then she froze.,0
Oh my...,1
she said.,0
Oh my stars.,1
I’m hallucinating.,1
Or can you see what I can see?,1
"I think I can,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"Well if you can see Uncle Jeff taking a space walk just outside our window, then you’re having the same hallucination that I’m having,",1
said Mum.,0
"I think we are,",1
said Dad. Fifteen minutes later they heard a metallic clunk as the space shuttled docked with the hotel.,0
"First Uncle Jeff, and then Sergei, the owner of the travel company, floated into the reception area.",0
Fred the Robot Butler said:,0
Welcome to the Space Hotel. The management of Holidays in Space wishes you a happy and comfortable stay.,1
"Hey kids, how do you like it up here?",1
boomed Uncle Jeff.,0
"Wicked,",1
said Jeremy.,0
But it would be nice to get down some time.,1
"And very soon you shall,",1
said Jeff. An hour later the family were strapped into their seats in the space shuttle.,0
"The descent to the desert of Kazakhstan took just thirty minutes, but the inside of the shuttle was as hot as a sauna on the way down.",0
"They landed on the runway with two or three bumps, but no real trouble.",0
"When they climbed down the ladder onto the tarmac, Jeremy looked up at the sky and said:",0
Uncle Jeff’s up there somewhere.,1
said Jemima.,0
He got his space trip after all.,1
"You see, after all the millionaires cancelled their Holidays in Space, the only people confident enough to fly in the shuttle were Sergei and Uncle Jeff. According to Sergei, there was nothing much wrong with the shuttle from the safety point of view.",0
It just needed some routine maintenance after its first trip.,0
The story about the masking tape had been spread by a rival company and wasn’t true at all.,0
But the only way to prove that it wasn’t true was to make the trip himself.,0
"And the only other person who had enough faith to go with him, was Uncle Jeff. And in one week’s time, the shuttle would return to pick them up again and bring them back to Earth. And that’s the story of how Jeremy and Jemima, Mum and Dad, and Uncle Jeff spent their Christmas Holiday in space.",0
Katie returns for a story in which her mother buys her a black kitten to help her with her magic.,0
Katie puts a spell on the cat so that he can talk.,0
"Soon he is not only talking, he’s gossiping about all her friends.",0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Katie and the Cat Who Talked- ￼Every Saturday, not far from where Katie lived, there was a market.",0
Farmers came into town and set up their stalls in a car park.,0
"They sold the tastiest apples, the freshest eggs, and all sorts of vegetables that still had the mud from the fields on them.",0
"Katie liked to go there with her mum who looked for unusual herbs like sorrel, angelica and coltsfoot.",0
"Sometimes she made spells with these herbs, but quite often she just put them in her soups.",0
"One morning, as they were leaving the market, they passed an old lady who was standing on the corner holding a wicker basket.",0
"Little girl, do you want to see what I have inside this basket?",1
she asked.,0
"Katie was a bit afraid, because she thought that perhaps she had something bad in the basket, like apples that were poisonous.",0
"Besides, she knew that she must never speak to strangers.",0
But then she heard a little sound.,0
Mee-ow.,1
"Oh Mum, can we look please?",1
she asked.,0
Katie’s mum was curious to see too.,0
"The old lady pulled back the cloth, and they saw that inside the basket, four little kittens were clambering over each other.",0
"Oh please, they are so cute, Mum can we have one?",1
Mum shook her head.,0
"Oh please, please, can we have a kitten?",1
I want one so much.,1
"I promise to look after it and besides,",1
"she whispered,",0
a cat could help me with my magic.,1
One of the kittens was black.,0
Mum picked it up by the scruff on the back of its neck – the way a mother cat picks up her kittens.,0
She examined it closely and made sure that he was completely black without even the smallest white mark on its paws.,0
"All right,",1
she said.,0
We’ll buy this one.,1
"Back at home, the fluffy little creature did loads of incredibly cute things like playing with a ball of wool, looking in the mirror and thinking there was another cat there, and climbing in and out of Katie’s shoe.",0
"Mum, what sort of magic can cats do?",1
asked Katie.,0
"Cats are very clever and can be your ears and eyes,",1
said Mum.,0
But you must be very careful.,1
Cats don’t have much tact.,1
They can get you into all sorts of trouble.,1
"By my cat’s clever,",1
said Katie. She picked up her kitten and kissed him.,0
"I shall call you Solomon,",1
she said.,0
Because you are so much wiser than ordinary cats.,1
The months passed and Solomon grew up into a serious young cat who liked to sit and watch Katie do her homework.,0
"He often went out for long walks on his own, and Katie wondered where he wandered and what he saw.",0
Wouldn’t it be nice to ask him?,1
she thought.,0
And then she had an idea.,0
She went into her mother’s room and pulled down a volume from the Encyclopedia of Magic. There were some spells in there that were so secret that they weren’t even on the internet yet.,0
She turned through the pages of magic instructions that began with,0
and she found the one that looked the most promising for her purpose.,0
It was called,0
Cat’s Tongue,1
Katie went out into the garden to pick some catnip.,0
"She said a magic spell over it, and came back in to the kitchen to give it to Solomon. He purred appreciatively because there was nothing that he liked more than catnip.",0
"Now Solomon,",1
"said Katie,",0
can you tell me where you went on your walk today and what you saw?,1
"Murrrrr,",1
said Solomon.,0
"I’m afraid I don’t understand cat talk,",1
said Katie.,0
"I was just thinking,",1
"said Solomon,",0
what to tell you first.,1
Would you like to know about the mouse that I caught and ate for breakfast?,1
Not really.,1
Or would you like to know about the oak tree where I sharpen my claws?,1
Not especially.,1
Then shall I tell you who I saw with your friend Isis?,1
said Katie.,0
That would be rather more interesting.,1
"I saw Isis sitting in her garden with Tim eating ice creams, and do you know what?",1
They kissed!,1
They didn’t?,1
They did.,1
I saw it.,1
"And Katie was so excited that she couldn’t wait to tell everyone at school all about Isis and Tim, but of course she wasn’t going to tell Isis or Tim themselves, because they obviously already knew about it.",0
"Ugh, how could she?",1
"He has blackheads on his nose,",1
exclaimed Jane.,0
But how do you know?,1
"asked Ravinia. As Katie couldn’t say how she knew, because her talking cat was meant to be a secret, so she just said that she saw it all with her own eyes.",0
"The next day, when Katie came home, she found Solomon sleeping on top of a pile of laundry.",0
"Solomon, wake up you sleepy moggy!",1
What did you see today?,1
"Well,",1
"he said with a stretch and a yawn,",0
I was walking along the top of the school wall when I saw your friend Isis again.,1
She was talking to Ravinia and she said that you were a spy and a tell-tale-tit.,1
She didn’t!,1
exclaimed Katie with great indignation.,0
"Of course, you don’t have to believe me if you don’t want to.",1
"I do believe you Solomon. I just meant, like, how dare she say a thing like that?",1
She’s my friend.,1
Well you know what?,1
I’m not speaking to her anymore.,1
"And for the rest of the week at school, Isis and Katie pretended not to notice each other, even though they were normally the best of friends.",0
"When they weren’t falling out with each other, Isis and Katie would share secrets and problems, and quite often, when they got home from school, they would chatter on the phone because they liked each other’s company so much.",0
Now Katie wasn’t speaking to Isis. So she called Paul who used to go her school.,0
"Isis was looking out of her bedroom window at the spot where she had sat with Tim. Tim had given her one tiny little kiss, as an experiment, just to see what all the fuss was about that sort of thing.",0
And she had liked it.,0
She would have liked it less if she had known that Katie was spying on her?,0
But how?,0
The garden had a high wall all around it.,0
Had she climbed up a tree?,0
"Or flown over on her broomstick, more like.",0
"But however she had spied that kiss, the hurtful thing was that she had gossiped about it.",0
"When the rumours started to spread around school, thanks to Katie and her big mouth, Tim became embarrassed and stopped being her friend.",0
"While Isis was thinking these sad thoughts, she noticed that a black cat was sitting in the apple tree, watching the birds flutter around the nut container that swung to and fro from a branch.",0
"I know you,",1
she said.,0
You’re that witch Katie’s cat.,1
And then Isis thought to herself.,0
That’s it!,1
The cat is Katie’s spy...,1
but I bet I can turn that cunning creature into a double agent.,1
Soon he’ll be spying for me.,1
It doesn’t take much to win a faithless cat’s heart.,1
She knew exactly what to do.,0
Two minutes later she was walking down the garden path carrying a saucer of clotted cream.,0
"Here kitty, kitty,",1
she called.,0
That was all it took.,0
Soon Solomon’s rough tongue was lapping up the cream.,0
Now would you like to come inside and have some gorgeous smelly sardines?,1
asked Isis.,0
"I don’t mind if I do,",1
"said Solomon. When Solomon had eaten the tinned sardines in the kitchen, Isis lifted up the feline fellow and took him to her room where she put him down on her big soft pink pillow.",0
As he stretched out she tickled his belly.,0
"Mrrr. You sure know how to spoil a cat,",1
said Solomon.,0
"I sure do,",1
said Isis.,0
"And you can come here, drink cream, feast on sardines, and lie on my pillow any time you want.",1
But tell me.,1
Who is your owner and what is he or she like?,1
"Oh nobody special, just a little witch called Katie,",1
purred Solomon.,0
I know her.,1
"She has a boyfriend, hasn’t she?",1
"asked Isis, taking a stab in the dark.",0
Not really.,1
"She just holds hands with Paul sometimes,",1
he said.,0
And Isis thought that was rather interesting.,0
"And tell me,",1
"she said,",0
what does she say about the other kids at school?,1
Oh nothing worth knowing.,1
"Just that Annabel has bandy legs, and Georgie is a cry baby, and Ravinia can’t be trusted to keep a secret, and Laura is so stupid that she takes notes when she’s watching cartoons on TV.",1
That was more than enough information.,0
Five minutes later Isis had dialed Katie’s number and was relating back all the interesting facts that she had just learnt.,0
"That’s s all rubbish,",1
said Katie.,0
It’s a tissue of lies.,1
"No, it’s not.",1
It’s the perfect truth.,1
"Prove it,",1
challenged Katie. And she immediately wished that she hadn’t said that.,0
All right I will prove it.,1
"Your black moggy is lying on my pillow in my room and I’m going to invite Annabel, Georgie, Ravinia and Laura round to hear what he has to say.",1
"And then I’m going to tell the entire world about you and Paul. In fact, I’m going to send record dedications for soppy love songs to all the radio stations on your behalf.",1
"No, you wouldn’t.",1
Try me.,1
And Katie realised that she was in a tight spot – one that magic wouldn’t necessarily get her out of.,0
she said.,0
I’m sorry that I gossiped about you.,1
"And although Isis didn’t accept her apology right away, the next day at school, when she found herself next to Katie in the dinner queue she asked:",0
How’s your cat?,1
I don’t know.,1
He’s not talking to me.,1
You mean that even your cat doesn’t talk to you any more?,1
Not since last night.,1
I took the spell off him.,1
I’m not so sure that a talking cat is such a good idea.,1
"And after that, Isis and Katie became best friends again – because everyone needs somebody special that they can talk to.",0
Endnote -,0
Warning:,0
"It's a rather scary story, as it is all about a giant who likes nothing better than to eat people.",0
"Odysseus, the craftiest man alive, is sailing home from the Trojan War. He and his men go ashore and find a cave with sheep, goats and cheese.",0
"They make themselves comfortable, only to find that the cave belongs to a one-eyed giant.",0
"Adapted by Bertie. In the Cyclops' Cave -   After the Greeks destroyed the fabulous city of Troy, they sailed home in their black ships, but not all of them received a warm welcome by any means.",0
"When King Agamemnon returned to his palace in Argos, his Queen Clytemnestra was far from pleased to see him.",0
"You see, before he left for Troy, King Agamemnon had sacrificed the life of their daughter so that the gods would send a fair wind to blow the Greek ships to Troy. Now, Clytemnestra hated her husband more than any man alive, but she pretended to be all smiles and kisses.",0
"While Agamemnon was relaxing his weary limbs in the warm, soapy water, Queen Clytemnestra crept up with a knife and killed him.",0
"On the island of Ithaca, a very different Queen, whose name was Penelope, was longing for the safe return of her husband.",0
She had to wait quite a while though.,0
"His journey home took him ten long years, and all that time, Penelope was surrounded by men who wanted to marry her and steal her husband’s throne.",0
She said to her suitors:,0
"Gentlemen, I am spinning a magnificent bedspread for my wedding night.",0
"First let me finish making it, and then I will say which one of you I shall choose for my new husband."" Every day Penelope worked at spinning her wheel, and every night she unpicked her threads, so that her work was never done.",0
"In this way she kept the men waiting, for she was sure that her husband was still alive and would return home safely to her arms.",0
His name was Odysseus and he was famous all over the world for his quick mind and his cunning tricks.,0
"It was Odysseus who had come up with the idea of the wooden horse, which led to the destruction of Troy. Despite all his resourcefulness, he made slow progress home, for Poseidon the god of the seas was angry with him.",0
"The sea god sent howling winds to blow Odysseus off his course, and fierce storms to buffet his ships.",0
This is the story of why he was so angry.,0
"Odysseus and his men sailed in their swift boats, their oars turning up white foam on the wine-dark sea.",0
One evening they landed on a small island.,0
He and his men hunted down goats for their dinner and that evening they ate roast meat on the beach.,0
"In the morning, Odysseus looked across the water to the mainland.",0
"He saw a wild country, with wooded mountains wrapped in mist.",0
He decided to go and see what kind of people lived on that land.,0
"He told most of his men to wait behind, but he sailed across the water in his own boat with his crew of twenty brave men.",0
"On his back he took a skinful of fine wine that had been given to him by a priest of the sun god, Apollo. He thought it would make a good gift for his hosts, whoever they might be.",0
"When they got ashore, they scrambled up the steep cliffs and explored the woods.",0
"They saw nobody, but high up on the mountain they discovered a vast cave.",0
"Inside they found lambs and goat kids living in pens, and on the ground were piles of round cheeses and barrels full of milk.",0
"The men were all for stealing the cheese and a few lambs, and taking them back to the ship as fast as possible.",0
"However, Odysseus commanded them to sit down and wait for the owner of the cave, for he was sure he would be a rich man, and generous to travellers, according to the laws of the gods.",0
So they waited until evening.,0
"In the meantime they lit a fire, and helped themselves to the cheese and milk.",0
"Towards sunset, they heard the tinkling of sheep bells, and they knew that the owner of the cave was driving his flocks back home.",0
"First the sheep came running into the cave, and then they were followed by a giant who had to stoop to enter through the door.",0
"He had one eye in the middle of his forehead, as do all those who belong to the race of the Cyclops. The Cyclops was astonished to find a band of men making themselves comfy in his cave and eating his cheese.",0
He blinked with his one eye and asked in a terrible voice:,0
And who might you be?,1
Odysseus replied:,0
"We are Greeks on our way back from the glorious war in Troy. Lord Zeus, the king of all the gods is our protector, and according to his laws you must treat us kindly, provide us with gifts, and send us safely on our way.",1
"Instead of replying, the Cyclops went to the door of the cave and rolled a great stone into the opening so that the exit was blocked.",0
Now the only light in the cave was from the fire lit by Odysseus and his men.,0
What care I for the laws of Zeus?,1
said the Cyclops.,0
"I am strong, and besides, I am protected by Poseidon, the god of the seas and of earthquakes too, for he is my father.",1
"Odysseus and his men retreated into the dark corners of the cave, but the Cyclops could see them in the dark with his one eye, for it glowed as bright as the fire.",0
Don’t talk to me of laws!,1
said the Cyclops.,0
I know your type.,1
"You are scoundrels who sail the wine-dark seas, raiding the people who live on their shores, killing and burning and plundering whatever takes your fancy.",1
"In fact, you are lawless pirates, that’s who you are!",1
With that he grabbed up two of the men and stuffed them into his mouth.,0
he said.,0
"""Nice dinner.",0
Oh Lord Zeus save us from this horrific monster!,1
But the Cyclops just chuckled to himself and lay down to sleep by the fire.,0
"Odysseus drew his sword and was tempted to drive it straight into the heart of the giant while he slept, but then he thought:",0
"If I kill the Cyclops, revenge will be sweet, but I will also be sending us to our doom, for we shall never remove that great boulder from the door of the cave.",1
Not twenty horses could pull that rock away.,1
We shall surely remain here till we die.,1
"And so he and his men lay down and wept for their lost friends, while Odysseus wracked his brains for a better way to avenge them.",0
"In the morning, the Cyclops awoke and without haste ate two more of Odysseus’ men (for breakfast).",0
"Then he led his sheep out to the pasture, being careful to roll the rock into the mouth of the cave after him.",0
"The Cyclops had left behind him a great walking stick, of the sort that shepherds use to climb over the mountains.",0
This gave Odysseus an idea.,0
He ordered his men to look for sharp pieces of flint in the back of the cave.,0
They took these and used them to sharpen the end of the stick into a cruel point.,0
Next Odysseus told his men to pick up the stick and harden the point in the fire.,0
The Cyclops tried a cup of the wine and he liked it.,0
"For once you speak the truth, oh pirate,",1
he said.,0
"This wine is indeed the finest I have ever tasted,",1
and he picked up the skin and guzzled some more wine down.,0
"Tell me little man, he said, ""what is your name?",1
"""My name,",0
"is Nobody. That is what I am called by my friends who love me, and my enemies who fear me.",1
"Well I am neither your friend, nor do I fear you,",1
"said the Cyclops, ""but I shall call you Nobody all the same, if that is how you like to be called.",0
"For in truth, you will be nobody soon when I’ve eaten you.",0
"But as a reward for your gift of fine wine, I shall not eat you till I have eaten all the others.",0
What’s happened to you?,1
they called from outside the cave.,0
"Nobody has hurt me,",1
wailed the Cyclops.,0
Nobody came into my cave and did this to me.,1
"The other giants were baffled by the Cyclops’ cries, since he insisted that",0
nobody,1
was harming him.,0
"Much confused, they all went back to bed.",0
"In the morning, the Cyclops was careful to make sure that Odysseus and his men did not slip out of the cave.",0
"As each of his sheep went out, he felt it carefully to check that a man was not riding on its back, but he did not know that Odysseus had ordered his followers to tie the sheep together in threes, and that now they were clinging upside down between the sheep.",0
The last animal to leave the cave was the old ram with curly horns.,0
Odysseus was clinging to his underside.,0
The Cyclops stroked the ram and said:,0
"Cruel Nobody has blinded me, but I shall have my revenge.",1
"I shall find him tonight cowering in the corner of the cave, and I shall eat him for dinner, chewing very slowly.",1
"When Odysseus and his men were clear of the cave, they started to scramble down the cliffs to the beach, taking some of the lambs with them.",0
"They pulled their boat out from where it was hidden in the brush wood, and started to row swiftly out to their friends on the island.",0
"Up above on the cliffs they saw the Cyclops, standing as tall as an oak tree and bellowing with rage:",0
Oh woe is me!,1
"Nobody has blinded me in my one eye, and now Nobody is escaping across the seas!",1
Odysseus stood up in the boat and called out to him:,0
"Cruel Cyclops, you broke the laws of Zeus by eating my men and now you have your just desserts.",1
Never again shall you see the light of day with that terrible eye of yours!,1
"His men begged him to sit down in the boat and keep quiet, but he carried on calling out insults to his enemy.",0
In reply the giant picked up a huge rock and hurled it down into the sea.,0
It sent up a great wave that rocked the boat so that it almost turned over.,0
"When it was steady, hot-headed Odysseus stood up in the boat again, and despite the pleas of his men he called out:",0
Listen here you monstrous giant.,1
"If anyone asks you who did this to you, say it was swift-witted Odysseus, son of Laertes, sacker of cities.",1
"Yes, it was none other than Odysseus of rocky Ithaca who took the eye of the cruel, stupid Cyclops.",1
The Cylops sent another boulder flying into the sea and this sent up another great wave that almost sank the boat again.,0
Now the Cyclops went down on his knees and prayed to Poseidon:,0
"Oh great ruler of the seas, mighty lord who makes the earth quake and tremble.",1
"Dear Poseidon, my father...",1
hear my prayer.,1
"I did not think to fear this swift-witted Odysseus, son of Laertes, sacker of cities.",1
He was such a puny and feeble little man.,1
"Please, oh great sea god, grant me revenge.",1
Send a terrible storm to pick up his ships like toys and fling them back down again so that they smash into smithereens and all his brave men are drowned.,1
"Or if it is not permitted to end his life before its time, then make sure he only returns home, after many long years of great suffering, and that he finds his land in turmoil, and the echoing halls of his palace full of greedy robbers devouring his wealth.",1
"Oh sea lord, hear the prayer of Polyphemus the Cyclops – for I am your loving son.",1
"The sea god Poseidon heard the prayer of his son, the cruel Cyclops with one blind eye, and that is the reason why Odysseus spent ten long years buffeted by the cruel seas before he reached his home land.",0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Proofread by Claire Deakin & Jana Elizabeth. So he swam up behind Bertie and said:,0
Woooooooo!,1
But Bertie didn’t shriek and shake with fright like he was supposed to do.,0
In fact he didn’t do anything at all.,0
So Tim again said:,0
"""Woooooooo!"" Only louder.",0
"Bertie still didn’t move, and so Tim said:",0
Bertie why aren’t you frightened when I come up behind you and say woooooo?,1
Bertie opened his eyes.,0
He had been dozing after a big lunch of flies and green slime.,0
"Because, little Tim, if you want to truly frighten somebody, you need to go more like this:",0
"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" Tim was so scared that he swam around the pond six times backwards.",0
He was still shaking when he said:,0
"""Ooh, Bertie, that was so very scary.",0
Just like a real ghost.,0
"In fact, I wanted to ask you - do ghosts really truly-wooly exist?"" ",0
"Oh yes,",1
said Bertie.,0
I know because once I was haunted by a ghost.,1
"When he said that, Tim begged Bertie to tell the story of how he was haunted by a ghost.",0
It happened one Halloween when Bertie was still a small prince and lived in the palace.,0
"The royal family was eating pumpkin soup for dinner when Prince Harry, who was Bertie’s annoying little brother, said:",0
Bertie I bet you are scared of ghosts.,1
Bertie replied:,0
Don’t annoy me when I’m eating.,1
But Harry went on:,0
"In fact, I bet you are far too scaredy to sleep in the haunted room tonight.",1
"The haunted room was in the north tower, and legend held that anyone who slept there on Halloween would meet the ghost of King George, who had lived four hundred years ago, and had been murdered by his wicked stepmother.",0
"The last person who had slept in that room had been Bertie’s great-uncle Charles, and he had gone stark raving mad.",0
"For sure, Bertie didn’t want to sleep in the haunted room.",0
"Equally he didn’t want to admit that he was frightened, however.",0
So he pretended not to be listening.,0
But Harry wouldn’t stop.,0
He started to chant:,0
"Scaredy-cat, scaredy, scaredy, scaredy cat!",1
"The royal nanny told Harry to pipe down, but Bertie knew that he would have no princely honour until he dared to sleep in the haunted room.",0
"So after dinner he took his pillow, his duvet and his soft toy giraffe over to the north tower and settled in for the night.",0
"I don’t know if you have ever tried to stay the night in a haunted room, but it isn’t easy to get off to sleep.",0
"Every time the wind blows and the trees rustle outside your window you feel, well, just a bit like you are about to meet a ghost.",0
"If you hear any creaking floorboards, that’s it...",0
You are really frightened.,0
So Bertie didn’t sleep.,0
"He sat up in bed and waited for the ghost of King George. Around midnight, he turned up.",0
At first Bertie didn’t see him.,0
He just heard him laugh.,0
But it wasn’t a scary laugh.,0
It was more deep and jolly like:,0
Ho ho ho.,1
Then the king appeared on the end of Bertie’s bed and said:,0
"Hey, you heard this one?",1
What do you call a witch who lives on the beach?,1
A sandwich of course.,1
Ha ha.,1
"Bertie laughed too, because the ghost was much funnier than he had been expecting.",0
And how about this?,1
Went on the king.,0
What do you get when you cross a black cat with a lemon?,1
"I don’t know,",1
admitted Bertie.,0
A sour-puss!,1
Oh dear.,1
I can’t tell you how glad I am that you came to sleep here tonight.,1
I haven’t shared a good joke with anyone in centuries.,1
"After that, Bertie and the ghost sat up and told each other jokes and stories until it was almost dawn.",0
"They were both laughing so much that Harry could hear them, and his room was in a different tower all together.",0
When the sky was just starting to get light the ghost said:,0
"""Well I must be off now.",0
But it would be so nice to spend a little more time having fun.,0
"I say, will you let me haunt you?",0
Well alright then.,1
I’ll let you haunt me.,1
But you must promise not to frighten anyone.,1
Except for my pesky brother Harry of course...,1
And the royal nanny.,1
It might be quite fun for her to see a ghost.,1
"And that’s how Bertie became haunted by the ghost of King George. Wherever Bertie went, the ghost went too.",0
At first it was quite fun.,0
"When Harry tried to steal Bertie’s chocolate biscuits, the ghost slammed the tin shut on his fingers and made him go:",0
ye-ouch!,1
"And Harry was completely puzzled about how it had happened, because only Bertie could see the ghost.",0
"Similarly, when the royal nanny went to the hairdressers, the ghost put green dye in the shampoo so that she came home looking like she had slime growing on her head.",0
"And when Bertie was playing in goal for the palace soccer team, the ghost helped him save a penalty, and all the team’s supporters cheered Bertie to the sky.",0
But being haunted wasn’t all good.,0
"No, not by any means...",0
"Another time, Prince Boris, who is bigger than Bertie and a bit of a bully, was giving Bertie some bother in the school playground.",0
"Bertie was trying to talk his way out of the situation, but the ghost came along and biffed Boris on the nose.",0
"Bertie and he had to go and see the headmaster and explain that it wasn’t him who had biffed Boris, but somebody else, and he couldn’t say who because that would be telling.",0
"Unfortunately, the ghost had rather a silly sense of humour.",0
Sometimes in class he would blow a raspberry at the teacher and Bertie would get the blame.,0
He also thought it was funny to put a whoopie cushion on the Queen Mother’s chair.,0
He also liked splashing in puddles and getting Bertie’s school uniform all wet and muddy.,0
"None of these things were so very bad, though Bertie was getting a little bit bored of the ghost and its tricks - and he was feeling rather tired because the ghost stayed up all night and told jokes.",0
"Then one day, the ghost went too far.",0
It happened like this...,0
"The king who was Bertie’s father, wasn’t very strict in general, but he did have one rule.",0
He was absolutely forbidden to touch his musket.,0
"His musket was like a very fancy gun, with gold plating and curly engravings.",0
"It hung above the fireplace in his study, and there it stayed.",0
That was the rule.,0
The ghost didn’t obey rules because he didn’t have to.,0
"He could do anything he liked, and nobody except Bertie would know that it was him who had done it.",0
One evening the ghost went through the wall into the king’s study and took the musket and brought it up to the top of the north tower.,0
"From there he had a good view of the palace gardens, and he started to use the musket to shoot the king’s vegetables.",0
Splat went a prize pumpkin.,0
"Plop went one tomato after the other, and,",0
ha ha ha!,1
Went the ghost.,0
"The Queen Mother’s poodle came into the garden, and the ghost shot her too.",0
"Fortunately he missed, but he almost scared the life out of her.",0
"The king came outside to see what the noise was about, and all he could see was the musket pointing out of the haunted room in the North Tower. The only person who ever dared to go up there was Bertie. Bertie was in trouble.",0
Big trouble.,0
"He tried to explain that it was the ghost who had been shooting with the musket, but nobody would believe him.",0
The king stopped his pocket money and banned him from watching TV for a whole month.,0
That really was it.,0
Bertie was furious.,0
He told the ghost that he couldn’t haunt him anymore because he was causing too much trouble.,0
"But the ghost just laughed and said that he liked haunting Bertie, and Bertie could like it or lump it.",0
"Besides, it’s lonely up there in the tower not seeing a soul for hundreds of years on end.",1
I’m having far too much fun to go back to that afterlife.,1
Bertie was very sad and very fed up.,0
"He thought and thought about who could help him out of his predicament, and the only person he could think of was the palace librarian.",0
The librarian read ever so many books and knew all about the history of the palace and the royal family.,0
Perhaps he would know how to deal with the the ghost of King George. Or perhaps he would think that Bertie had gone nuts.,0
It all depended on whether or not he believed in ghosts.,0
"Fortunately, he did.",0
"Why of course I believe in ghosts,",1
he replied when Bertie asked.,0
"In fact, I was talking to one only the other day.",1
Not King George by any chance?,1
Asked Bertie.,0
"No, not that silly old fool,",1
said the librarian.,0
"As he was saying that, the ghost of King George was writing:",0
Look behind you!,1
with a marker pen on the wall of the library.,0
I met this particular ghost when I was visiting a library in a castle just north of here.,1
"Her name was Princess Beth and she was betrothed to King George, but his wicked stepmother murdered him before the wedding could take place.",1
Sad story really.,1
"She’s still pining for her long lost lover after all these centuries, and she’s so terribly lonely.",1
"I don’t suppose,",1
"said Bertie,",0
that we could send our King George to live with Princess Beth in her castle.,1
The librarian shook his head.,0
"It was only possible for a ghost to move about if it haunted someone, and nobody would want to be haunted by a ghost as mischievous as King George. But Bertie was haunted by him already, and so the next day he took a royal train to the north of the country to visit the castle of Princess Beth - and because King George was haunting Bertie, he had to go with him.",0
"And that’s the story of how the ghost of King George was reunited with his long lost lover, Princess Beth, and from then on they lived together in the castle in the north, and were happy playing games and telling each other jokes, and Bertie returned home, unhaunted, and free from ghostly bother.",0
Download the audio of Beauty and the Beast The acoustic guitar and sitar music add to its exotic atmosphere.,0
"At last, he saw some sort of track.",0
"At the beginning it was rough and slippery, but soon it led him into an avenue of orange trees covered with flowers and fruit – but here there was no snow.",0
He saw a flight of stone steps.,0
He went up them into a great castle.,0
Inside he passed through several splendid rooms.,0
Everywhere in the castle there was a deep silence.,0
"At last, he stopped in a small room where a fire was burning.",0
He lay down on a couch and very soon fell into a sweet sleep.,0
He woke up feeling hungry.,0
"He was still alone, but a good dinner had been laid on a little table.",0
"He began to eat, hoping that he might soon have an chance to thank his kind host, whoever it might be - but no one appeared.",0
"Then he went down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet.",0
"The path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelled such beautiful flowers.",0
"Then he remembered a promise he had made to his youngest daughter, who was so lovely that everyone knew her as Beauty. Before setting out on his journey, he had asked his daughters what presents they would like him to bring back for them.",0
"The five eldest wished for jewels and fine clothes, but Beauty asked only for a single rose.",0
"Now, as he stopped to pick a rose to take home to Beauty, he was startled by a strange noise behind him.",0
"Turning around, he saw a frightful ugly Beast, which seemed to be very angry and sad and said in a terrible voice,",0
Who said that you could pick my roses?,1
Was it not enough that I let you say in my palace and was kind to you?,1
"This is the way you thank me, by stealing my flowers!",1
You shall not go unpunished!,1
The merchant was terrified by these furious words.,0
"He dropped the fatal rose, and throwing himself on his knees, cried,",0
"Pardon me, noble sir.",1
I am truly grateful to you for your kindness.,1
I could not imagine that you would mind so much if I took such a little thing as a rose.,1
"The Beast was still furious, however, and cried,",0
Excuses and flattery will not save you from the death you deserve!,1
Alas!,1
Thought the merchant.,0
My daughter’s rose has put me in this terrible danger.,1
"He began to tell the Beast of his journey, not forgetting to mention how Beauty had asked him for a rose.",0
"I beg you to forgive me, for I meant no harm,",1
he pleaded.,0
"The Beast thought for a moment, and then he said, in a less terrible voice,",0
I will forgive you on one condition – that is if you will give me one of your daughters.,1
Cried the merchant.,0
What excuse could I invent to bring her here?,1
No excuse!,1
Answered the Beast.,0
She must come willingly.,1
Go home.,1
I give you a month to see if one of your daughters will save you.,1
"If none of them is willing to come to me, you must come back alone.",1
"Do not think that you can hide from me, for if you do not keep your word I will come and fetch you!",1
"The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went to the stable where his horse was ready for his journey.",0
"It carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight of the palace, and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped before the door of his house.",0
His daughters rushed to meet him.,0
"At first he told them nothing of the Beast, but as he gave Beauty her the rose he said sadly,",0
Here is what you asked me to bring you;,1
you little know what it has cost.,1
"Later that evening he told his family of his adventures from beginning to end, and then his daughters wept loudly.",0
"The girls were very angry with Beauty, and said to her that it was all her fault, and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her foolish wish.",0
"Poor Beauty said to them,",0
Who could have guessed that asking for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery?,1
"But as I made this mistake, it is only right that I should be the one to suffer for it.",1
I will go back to the Beast with father.,1
When the fatal day came she said goodbye to her sisters and everything she loved.,0
"She mounted a horse together with her father, and it seemed to fly rather than gallop.",0
"They soon reached the avenue of orange trees, where statues were holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace, music sounded softly from the courtyard.",0
"Her father led her to the little room where he had stayed, and there they found a splendid fire burning, and a delicious supper set out on the table.",0
"After they had finished their meal they heard the Beast’s footsteps approaching, and Beauty clung to her father.",0
"When the ugly Beast appeared she tried hard to hide her terror, and she nodded to him politely.",0
"This clearly pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a voice that might have struck fear into the boldest of hearts,",0
"Good evening, old man.",1
"Good evening, Beauty.",1
"The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly,",0
"Good evening, Beast.",1
Have you come willingly?,1
Asked the Beast. Beauty answered bravely that she had come willingly to save her father.,0
"I am pleased with you,",1
said the Beast.,0
"As for you, old man,",1
"he added, turning to the merchant,",0
at sunrise tomorrow you will go.,1
"Then turning to Beauty, he said,",0
Take your father into the next room and help him to choose presents for your sisters.,1
Take everything they would wish for.,1
"Then he left them saying,",0
Goodbye Beauty. Goodbye old man.,1
In the next room they found splendid dresses fit for a queen.,0
When Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf.,0
"After choosing a vast quantity, she opened the last chest, which was full of gold.",0
"I think, father,",1
"she said,",0
that gold will be more useful to you.,1
"We had better take out the other things again, and fill the trunks with gold.",1
So they did this;,0
and at last the trunks were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!,0
"The Beast was making fun of us,",1
cried the merchant.,0
"He pretended to give us these things, knowing that I could not carry them away.",1
"Let us wait and see,",1
"answered Beauty. At sunrise, they went down into the courtyard, where two horses were waiting;",0
"one loaded with the two trunks, the other for the merchant to ride.",0
"As soon as he climbed into the saddle, he went off at such a pace that Beauty lost sight of him in an instant.",0
Then she began to cry and she went back to her room and fell into a deep sleep.,0
"She dreamed that she was walking by a stream when a young prince came up to her and said, in a voice that went straight to her heart,",0
"Ah, Beauty!",1
You are not so unlucky as you suppose.,1
"Only try to find me, no matter how I may be disguised, as I love you dearly.",1
Make me happy and you shall be happy.,1
"Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall have nothing left to wish for.",1
"What can I do, prince, to make you happy?",1
Said Beauty.,0
"Do not trust your eyes,",1
"he answered,",0
and set me free from my misery.,1
"When Beauty awoke, she began to think about the charming prince she had seen in her dream.",0
He said I could make him happy.,1
Said Beauty to herself.,0
It seems that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner.,1
How can I set him free?,1
I don’t understand it.,1
"After all, it was only a dream, so why should I worry about it?",1
"She got up to explore the castle, but she did not see anyone or hear any sound, and she began to find it rather dull.",0
"Only that evening, after supper, she heard the Beast coming, and she trembled with fear at what it might do.",0
"But he only said,",0
"Good evening, Beauty.",1
She answered cheerfully and managed to hide her terror.,0
"He spoke politely to her for about an hour, and asked her all about her life with her family.",0
"Then he said in a gruff voice,",0
"Do you love me, Beauty?",1
Will you marry me?,1
What shall I say?,1
"Cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the Beast angry by refusing.",0
"Say 'yes' or 'no' without fear,",1
he replied.,0
"No, Beast,",1
"said Beauty, hastily.",0
"Since you will not, goodnight Beauty,",1
he said.,0
"And she answered,",0
"Goodnight, Beast,",1
very glad to find that he had not attacked her.,0
"After he was gone, she was very soon in bed asleep, and dreaming of her unknown prince.",0
"He came to her and said to her,",0
"Ah, Beauty!",1
Why are you so unkind to me?,1
I fear I will be unhappy for many a long day still.,1
"The next morning, she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun shone, and all the fountains were playing.",0
"When she was tired she went back to the palace, and found a new room full of rare birds, so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and her head.",0
"Some of them were parrots and cockatoos that could talk, and they greeted Beauty by name.",0
"""Pretty little creatures,",0
"Oh how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room, that I could often hear you sing!"" When she left, she opened a door and found that it led straight into her own room.",0
"After supper, the Beast paid her his usual visit, and before he left he asked her as before, ",0
"Beauty, will you marry me?",1
"And when she refused, he gave her a gruff,",0
Goodnight,1
and left her.,0
"The days passed, and every evening the Beast asked her the same question and she gave him the same answer.",0
"Beauty felt that when she said,",0
"No, Beast,",1
he went away quite sad.,0
"But her happy dreams of the handsome young prince soon made her forget the poor Beast. Her prince always told to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many other equally baffling things which she could not understand.",0
"At last, happy as she was, Beauty began to long for her family.",0
"One night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her what was the matter.",0
Beauty was no longer afraid of him.,0
Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice.,0
She answered that she was longing to see her home once more.,0
"When he heard this, the Beast cried miserably,",0
"Beauty, have you the heart to leave an unhappy Beast like me?",1
Is it because you hate me that you want to escape?,1
"No, dear Beast,",1
answered Beauty softly.,0
"I do not hate you, and I should be very sorry never to see you anymore, but I long to see my father again.",1
"Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life.",1
"The Beast replied with a sigh,",0
"I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my life.",1
You may go.,1
"But remember your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may be sorry, for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful Beast dead.",1
"Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy.",0
"When at last she did begin to dream of her beloved prince she saw him stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.",0
What is the matter?,1
She cried.,0
"He looked at her reproachfully, and said,",0
"How can you ask me, cruel one?",1
"Don’t be so sad,",1
cried Beauty.,0
I am only going to let my father know that I am safe and happy.,1
I have promised my Beast that I shall come back.,1
I would not cause him pain by breaking my word.,1
He told me he would die if did not keep my promise to him.,1
What do you care for an ugly Beast?,1
Asked the prince.,0
"said Beauty,",0
It is not his fault that he is so ugly.,1
He is a very kind beast.,1
"Just then, she heard someone speaking not very far away.",0
She got up and then she suddenly heard her father’s voice.,0
She rushed out and greeted him.,0
She was home.,0
"Her sisters were quite astonished to see her, and there was no end to their questions about her life with the Beast. Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams.",0
"After much thought, he answered,",0
"You tell me yourself that The Beast, frightful as he is, loves you dearly and is kind and gentle to you.",1
I think the prince means that you should do as the Beast wishes in spite of his ugliness.,1
"But Beauty’s thoughts were full of her handsome dream prince, and she could not imagine marrying the Beast. When the two months were over, Beauty’s sisters begged her not to return to the ugly beast, but to stay with her family.",0
"At first she could not refuse them, and she stayed on for a few days more.",0
Then one night she had a different dream from usual.,0
"She saw not her prince, but the Beast. He was lying in a cave and he looked ill and in pain.",0
Then Beauty remember his words that he might die if she did not stay true to her word.,0
"The next day, Beauty said goodbye to her father and all her sisters, and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring around upon her finger, and said firmly,",0
I wish to go back to see my Beast again.,1
"She fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock saying,",0
"Beauty, Beauty,",1
"twelve times in its musical voice, which told her at once that she was in the palace once more.",0
"Everything was just as before, and her birds were so glad to see her!",0
"Beauty thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to see the Beast again, that she felt as if suppertime would never come.",0
When it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened.,0
She ran down into the garden to search for him.,0
"Up and down the paths and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered.",0
"At last, quite tired, she stopped for a minute’s rest, and saw that she was standing opposite a cave, and in it lay the Beast, asleep.",0
"Quite glad to have found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but to her horror, he did not move or open his eyes.",0
"He is dead, and it is all my fault,",1
"said Beauty, crying bitterly.",0
"But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed.",0
She fetched some water from the nearest fountain and sprinkled it over his face.,0
"Slowly, he began to open his eyes.",0
"Ah Beauty,",1
"he said faintly,",0
now you see what happens when you do not keep your word.,1
"Beast,",1
she cried.,0
"I never knew how much I loved you until now, when I feared I was too late to save your life.",1
Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am?,1
asked the Beast.,0
You only came just in time.,1
I was dying because I thought you had forgotten your promise.,1
"Go back now and rest, I shall see you by and by.",1
"Beauty went back to the palace, where supper was awaiting her;",0
"and afterward the Beast came in as usual, and asked about the time she had spent with her family, and if they had all been very glad to see her.",0
"When at last the time came for him to go, and he asked, as he had so often asked before,",0
"Beauty, will you marry me?",1
"She answered softly,",0
"Yes, dear Beast.",1
As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the palace;,0
"fireworks crackled and guns banged, and across the avenue of orange trees, in letters all made of fireflies, was written,",0
Long live the prince and his bride.,1
"Beauty meant to ask the Beast what it all meant, but he had gone.",0
In his place stood her long-loved prince!,0
"At the same moment, two ladies entered the room.",0
"Both were splendidly dressed, but one especially so.",0
"Her companion said,",0
"Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible magic spell that turned him into a Beast. They love one another, and your consent to their marriage is all they need to make them perfectly happy.",1
"I agree with all my heart,",1
cried the queen.,0
Then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the prince.,0
"said the fairy to Beauty,",0
I suppose you would like me to send for your father and sisters?,1
She did so.,0
"The marriage was celebrated the very next day, and Beauty and the prince lived happily ever after.",0
And that was the story of Beauty and the Beast.,0
"The Sheriff who Came to Dinner with Robin Hood Robin Hood liked to invite guests to dine with him at his table in Sherwood Forest. If his guests were rich and powerful he would ask them to pay for their dinner with gold or jewels - But if they were poor or down on their luck, he would help them out with money from his own coffers.",0
"In this story, I’ll tell you how Robin entertained the Sheriff of Nottingham – who was very rich and powerful indeed.",0
"Robin Hood’s most trusted outlaw was Little John. In fact, there was nothing little about him at all - he was huge.",0
"If there was one thing that he really loved, it was his food.",0
"In particular, he liked to eat venison – which is the meat of deer.",0
"There were plenty of deer in Sherwood Forest, but it was forbidden to shoot them by punishment of death.",0
The law didn’t stop Little John because he feared nothing or nobody.,0
"Sometimes he would arrive at Robin Hood’s lair with a bag full of hares, partridges, and pheasants and he would say to Robin,",0
"Come on my friend, let’s get a good fire going.",1
I’ll soon have these ready for roasting and what a fine dinner we shall have.,1
But quite often Robin would make Little John wait for his dinner until a rich and respectable guest had come to join them.,0
"At those times, when Little John was hungry, he would become very tetchy and bad tempered indeed.",0
"All the other robbers who lived with Robin Hood would stay out of his way, because nobody wanted to get into a fight with a man as big and strong as Little John. One day, Robin asked Little John to go into the city of Nottingham to see if he could pick up any news or gossip.",0
It so happened that on that same day there was a shooting competition in the market place.,0
"Little John could not resist a chance to show of his skill with his bow and arrow, and he paid the fee of one penny to join the contest.",0
Each archer had to shoot an arrow into a post.,0
"Those who missed dropped out, and those that hit it went on to the next round when the posts were moved further back.",0
Little John split six posts down the middle with his arrows.,0
Nobody else could match him.,0
The Sheriff of Nottingham gave him the first prize and declared:-,0
This man is the best archer that I ever did see.,1
"Say now, my hearty young man, what is your name and where were you born?",1
"I was born in Yorkshire,",1
"replied Little John, ""and my name is Reynold Grenelef.""",0
"Well then, Reynold Grenelef,",1
"said the Sheriff,",0
Come and work for me.,1
I will pay you twenty marks a year and give you food and shelter.,1
"If he had known who Little John really was, he would have taken him not to his house, but to the gaol - for the Sheriff was the law around those parts, and the law had no greater enemies than Robin Hood and Little John. At first Little John tried to think of a cheeky reply to the Sheriff’s offer, and then he thought to himself,",0
So help me.,1
I shall be the worst servant he ever had.,1
And he said out loud:,0
I thank your Lordship. I shall come to your house this evening and begin my service for you.,1
I promise that you will never have another servant to the like of Reynold Grenelef.,1
"That evening, Little John settled into his new home in the servant’s quarters in the mansion belonging to the Sheriff of Nottingham. He had not eaten all day, and so he called out to the steward who was in charge of the dining hall,",0
"Good steward I pray, when will dinner be?",1
"To which the Steward replied:,",0
There will be no dinner for you until the master gets back.,1
And when will that be?,1
asked Little John.,0
"Not until next week, for he’s gone hunting with the Abbot.",1
"At this, Little John picked up the steward and began to shake him.",0
What?,1
A whole week without food?,1
"That will be the worse for my temper, and your head, for I swear I’ll take a crowbar and beat you with it.",1
"The butler heard the row, and came to give the new servant a clout round the ears, but when he saw the size of Little John, he held back.",0
Little John pushed past him and kicked door open.,0
"Inside the kitchen he found a keg of wine, which he cracked open and began to guzzle from it.",0
"Then he seized a leg of lamb out of the pantry, and started to tear chunks of meat off it with his teeth.",0
"The cook had not seen Little John before, and was amazed that a stranger should dare to burst into his kitchen and help himself to food and drink.",0
He came up to Little John and gave him three good punches in the belly.,0
"Little John looked up and said,",0
Give me more of those.,1
I liked them well.,1
"Then the cook drew his sword, then Little John drew his.",0
"As neither would back away, they set about each other with their blades.",0
"Out on the road they fought, and across the green.",0
Their clashing steel made so much noise that you might have thought that two whole armies were in battle.,0
Their swords were made thick and strong for breaking open armour.,0
Neither man grew tired as they wielded their heavy weapons for over an hour.,0
"I swear by my true life,",1
"said Little John,",0
that you are the best swordsman that I ever did see.,1
"If only you can shoot as well with a bow, then you should come with me to Greenwood and join the band of Robin Hood. You’ll have three new sets of clothes a year and twenty marks for your purse.",1
"And the cook replied,",0
Set down your sword and we shall be friends.,1
"As they were both hungry after the fight, they went back to the Sheriff’s house and stuffed themselves with sweet meats from the pantry.",0
"After that, they gathered all the precious things that they could find around the house.",0
"They took goblets and plates, trays and caskets.",0
Nor did they forget the silver spoons.,0
They found a crowbar and broke into the safe where they found plenty of money in gold coins.,0
"All this they put into a chest and rode off with it to Greenwood and Robin Hood. Robin was greatly amused by Little John’s story of his time in the service of the Sheriff, and he was indeed pleased with the chest full of loot - but he said,",0
I cannot eat off the Sheriff’s plate unless his Lordship joins us here in Greenwood for dinner.,1
"Thinking this over, Little John said,",0
Then let me fetch the Sheriff to you.,1
"He rode off across the forest to the Sheriff’s hunting lodge, and waited for him to return back from the day’s hunting with his hounds.",0
"When the Sheriff saw his new servant he said,",0
So look who it is - Reynold Grenelef. What brings you here my man?,1
"Little John knelt before him and said,",0
Good master.,1
Five miles from here is one of the fairest sights I ever did see:,1
Tender young hares and a herd of sixty or more deer.,1
"I did not dare aim my arrows for fear of the law, but thought I’d come and to tell you what I saw.",1
"The Sheriff replied that it would be a delight to watch Little John display his hunting skills with the longbow and arrow and added,",0
"Fear not the law, for I am the law here and I would love to see this sport.",1
"Then Little John led the Sheriff across the forest but not to the hunting grounds, for he took him instead to the camp of Robin Hood and his band of outlaws.",0
"When the Sheriff saw that he was surrounded by brigands he exclaimed,",0
Reynold Grenelef. You have betrayed me!,1
"Little John replied with,",0
"Master, I swear it was not my fault, for your steward and your butler would not give me dinner.",1
"Then Little John made the Sheriff take off his fine clothes and gave them to his cook, who put them on.",0
"Robin invited the Sheriff, just wearing his shirt and britches, to sit down at his table with his cook on one side and his 'servant', Little John, on the other.",0
"He placed before him his own silver plate, and filled his own goblet with wine.",0
"The feast was a good one, but the Sheriff had lost his appetite.",0
He did not believe that he would leave the forest alive.,0
"Cheer up Lord Sheriff,",1
"said Robin,",0
for I give you your life.,1
You can live here with me for a year and I’ll teach you to be an outlaw.,1
"The Sheriff replied,",0
Better that in the morning you cut off my head.,1
So Robin said:,0
"Better in the morning that you should go free, but first you must swear an oath by St. Mary that you will never do any harm to me or my men.",1
"The Sheriff was too proud to agree to such a promise right away, but in the morning, after a night as the guest of Robin Hood, he thought better of it, and he agreed to swear the oath:",0
"For as long as I live I shall be Robin Hood’s best friend, and if any day or night, by water or by land, I shall ever find Robin Hood or any of his men, I shall help them in any way I can.",1
"When he had sworn his oath, the Sheriff went on his way home, still wearing just his shirt and breeches, and riding on a mule.",0
Surprise!,0
Here's a one-off Gladys story as a follow-up to our series earlier this year.,0
It's set at Christmas. Gladys feels she is on the brink of success in her career.,0
But not everyone realises that she has grown out of being a fixer for her sisters.,0
"Gladys’s Christmas Joy - Hello, this is Natasha, and we have a lovely Christmassy surprise for you.",0
"One of our most popular productions of two thousand and fourteen series in which our singing hero, Gladys, came back.",0
There were music and songs and when it was all over you kept on asking us why it had to come to an end.,0
"For all you Gladys fans out there, here is a story called 'Gladys’s Christmas Joy.' It was hard to believe that it was going to be Christmas all over again.",0
"It seemed just like yesterday that those tacky and tinsley number ones were playing, like ghosts of Christmas past.",0
"You heard them on the radio, you heard them at the winter fair, you heard them in the supermarkets as shoppers pushed their trolleys around picking up frozen turkeys, vintage puddings, and fake fur trees.",0
What particularly drove Gladys mad was that they were playing those hit songs of yore all day long in the cafe where she was working as a waitress.,0
"Yes, Gladys had not quite made it yet in the world of pop.",0
It was an unfortunate fact in the life of a girl who was half-way to becoming a superstar that she had no money.,0
The agents and music execs in California had promised her a bright future - but that was exactly what it was - a future.,0
And so here in the present she had taken her first job.,0
It was hard work and low wages.,0
"Most of the customers were nice, but some were rude, and her manager would say things like:",0
"Is it so hard to remember which drawer the forks go in, Gladys?",1
Do you really think those are suitable shoes for work Gladys?,1
"Do you have to look so stressed all the time, it puts the customers off their food?"" But somehow she did not mind any of that because this Christmas, unlike any other previous Christmases, she had every reason to think that things were going to be very different in a year’s time.",0
"she was thinking as she arranged the turkey sandwiches on a plate,",0
"they loved me in LA. Now, at last, I’m truly on my way.",1
"As she was walking home from work on a particularly cold evening, she felt her phone buzzing in her coat.",0
"She was surprised to see that the call was from Ava, whom she had known at school, but hadn’t spoken to in ages.",0
"She was always the second most sensible person in school after Gladys - and now that Gladys had done the totally unsensible thing of heading off to pursue fame and glory in the music biz, the school had made Ava head-girl.",0
"The teachers felt that they had had a narrow escape - because if they had made the obvious choice of Gladys, she would have let them all down with her rash flight of fancy.",0
"Hi Gladdy,",1
said Ava.,0
Long time no speak.,1
"Listen, I’m in charge of this year’s 'Help A Child In Need,' appeal at school, and you know me, I don’t like to do things by halves.",1
I’ve set myself a simple target.,1
I aim to raise more money for charity than any school in the country has ever done before.,1
"I’m nothing if not ambitious, hey?",1
"But it’s a cool idea, no?",1
I'm calling to ask for your assistance.,1
Gladys was walking along thinking:,0
"Uh-oh, this is more about Ava’s ego than about kids in need,",1
"and she really wanted to think of a polite way to get away, but she found herself saying:",0
"Why do you think I could help, Ava?",1
"Simple,",1
said Ava.,0
You arrange for your sisters to reform the chiX and put on a special charity gig here at the school.,1
We could name any price for a ticket and it would sell out in minutes.,1
"Maybe they could release a special Christmas single while they are about it, you know, with words like - Clap Your Hands Save the World, and all that stuff.",1
"Well, Ava, you know I would just love to help,",1
"said Gladys, a little insincerely,",0
"but my sisters don’t have any plans to regroup, and besides Laura lives in California.",1
"I know Gladdy, but you have such great people skills.",1
You’re the only person in the whole world who could win them over.,1
"The fans of the chiX would just love you to bits if you did,and remember it’s all in aid of such a good cause!",1
"Flattery will get you almost everywhere, Ava, but sorry no can do,",1
"said Gladys,",0
It just isn't possible.,1
Gladys was starting to feel more than a bit annoyed.,0
"She had slowed down her walk home to take this call, but what irked her even more was that Ava still saw her as a fixer for her sisters’ band.",0
She wanted to say:,0
"Don’t you realise that I’m me now, I’m Gladys, I’m the one with the talent and the drive and the will to succeed?",1
But instead she took her gloves off and put them in her pockets so that she could pinch herself on the back of her hand.,0
The sharp but harmless pain took her mind off her irritation.,0
Then Ava really put her foot in it:,0
"Strictly between me and you, Gladdy,",1
"she said,",0
It wouldn’t do you any harm to do the school a favour because if you ever wanted to come back and do your A Levels they would be less likely to refuse.,1
"Mrs Johnson was pretty cheesed off when you left early, and this is a golden opportunity to get back in her good books.",1
"Thanks Ava,",1
"said Gladys,",0
but I’m not coming back to school.,1
I’m doing alright on my own thanks.,1
"Well, nobody is more pleased to hear that than I am, Gladys. I’ll pop over and buy a turkey sandwich off you sometime.",1
"It took a lot to make Gladys angry, but when she reached home she was shaking so much with rage, that she found it hard to put the key in the latch of the door.",0
What’s up Glad?,1
asked her dad as he opened the door for her.,0
She stormed past him and headed up the stairs.,0
"Bad day at the sandwich shop, love?",1
he asked innocently.,0
she called back.,0
"Life’s perfect,",1
and she slammed her bedroom door.,0
"When she had calmed down, she checked her emails and saw, to her surprise, that there was a rare email from her sister Laura in LA. It was sent to all the sisters and said:",0
Just rushing to airport.,1
See you in London soon XXX.,1
That was about the most advance warning you could expect of a visit from Laura.,0
"Bother,",1
thought Gladys.,0
"They could do the gig, but I needn’t worry, because they wouldn’t do it without a lot of persuasion and organising by me.",1
"And then she felt a guilty pang, because although Ava was the most annoying person on the planet, the concert was for charity.",0
"As Laura was in town, it was inevitable that the sisters would get together.",0
They met on Sunday afternoon for a walk on Clapham Common. Gladys’s cheeks flushed red in the cold air.,0
"Laura and Mandy both wore Santa hats, which actually looked quite fetching.",0
They linked arms and went along doing high kicks and singing Jingle Bells at the tops of their voices.,0
Gladys did not have that kind of extroversion.,0
Seeing her sisters act like that made her wonder if she really had the right personality to be a performer.,0
"When they stopped to buy roasted chestnuts, she felt compelled to mention Ava’s request for the chiX to reunite and do a charity gig at school.",0
"That would be a laugh,",1
said Laura.,0
I’d love to see the annoyed look on those teachers’ faces.,1
"Yeah, we made it without their stupid lessons, gym classes and detentions.",1
"Yeah, let’s do it,",1
said Sam.,0
"Just a one-off for old time’s sake, and to take a look at the old place and remind ourselves what we escaped from.",1
And Mandy said:,0
"Can’t say I’m dying to do that all over again, but it is for charity.",1
"Bother,",1
thought Gladys.,0
"I’ll have to tell Ava. This is going to look great on her C.V. ‘Organised spectacular fundraiser for charity,’ she will say.",1
But in fact she made one stupid phone call.,1
"I’ll do all the work, and everyone else will take the credit.",1
Same old story.,1
When is my life going to change?,1
Gladys was nothing if not diligent.,0
"She spent a whole day off work on the phone and email, hiring sound and lighting equipment and searching for backing musicians.",0
She would have to pay for all this out of her savings.,0
"Her sisters promised to refund her, but she knew that she would have to ask each of them six times over for the money, and that meant sending eighteen nags in total.",0
"Then she had to get them together for rehearsals, and suddenly they all had busy diaries, even though on a normal day they spent their time sleeping and shopping.",0
This was starting to look like the worst Christmas of her life.,0
"As part of the preparations for the concert, Gladys went to a meeting at the school with Mrs Johnson and Ava. It was strange walking back through the gates.",0
"A teacher glanced at her, and she could see she was wondering why Gladys was not wearing uniform.",0
"Hello Miss,",1
"said Gladys, struggling to remember the teacher’s name.",0
"Hello,",1
"said the teacher, who could not remember Gladys. Gladys went to the school office and said:",0
"I have an appointment with Mrs Johnson. The secretary, who was new, looked in the diary and asked Gladys to go through to a meeting room and wait for the head teacher.",0
Ava arrived soon afterwards.,0
"You’ve done so well, Gladys,",1
"she said,",0
I knew you could.,1
Gladys cringed because she felt that the praise was insincere.,0
"Still somehow it felt that they were sitting side by side, one wearing school uniform, the other wearing a business suit.",0
"Then Mrs Johnson came in, saw Gladys and said:",0
"Hello Gladys."" Gladys stood up and held her hand out for her to shake in a business-like way.",0
"The head teacher looked at her hand with an expression of puzzlement, before taking it limply.",0
"When we first heard your plan,",1
"said Mrs Johnson,",0
the mood in the staff room was less than enthusiastic.,0
"It does not send out the right message that some of the less diligent students - I am talking about your sisters, not you, Gladys - find easy fame and fortune.",0
Some young and impressionable minds might not realise that a considerable amount of good luck helped them along.,0
It was as if they had won the lottery.,0
"I gather things have not been quite so easy for you, Gladys."" ",0
"I’m doing well thank you,",1
said Gladys.,0
"Well, you can thank Ava here for her hard work, persistence and powers of persuasion, because she brought some of the senior staff over to the point of view that this would raise a considerable sum of money for charity and show the school to the world in a positive light.",1
Gladys nodded.,0
"It was a bit rich that she was supposed to thank Ava, but she did her best to look grown-up and business-like, despite being talked down to.",0
She thought quietly to herself:,0
You won’t talk to me in that patronising tone after my career gets launched properly.,1
You’ll be begging me to come back and give a talk to the whole school on prize-giving day.,1
"After that, the meeting was fairly brief.",0
"Ava went back to her lessons, and Gladys went to talk to the head of drama and the school janitors about how they were going to arrange the concert in the assembly hall.",0
"The space was big enough to fit one,four hundred people, which was a nice size for a special gig.",0
"It wasn’t exactly the Otwo Arena, but it would feel quite cosy when it was packed with fans.",0
They talked mostly about the arrangements for security and evacuation in case of a fire.,0
Preparing for her sisters’ gig was taking up almost all of Gladys’s time.,0
She had given up her job in the sandwich shop.,0
But some of her evenings in December were an entirely different matter.,0
"Her connections in show biz, including Laura and Darren Wolfe, had invited her to some of the ritziest Christmas parties in London. They were the sort of dos where the celebrity spotters are held back by security guys in black suits, and the flashes of the cameras pulsate, and the party-goers pause on the red carpet to sign autographs with the adoring fans on the other side of the rope.",0
"Laura’s boyfriend had arranged a chauffeur driven limousine for one of these evenings, and as they sat in the back, Sam said to Gladys:",0
"Last time you wore that black dress, I didn’t like to say this, but it doesn’t suit you.",1
"As it happened, Gladys was particularly fond of that dress because it was the one she had bought for her evening out with Darren Wolfe. In her heart she knew that Sam was jealous of how good she looked in it, but there was still part of her still-sensitive soul that hemorrhaged confidence.",0
She felt low all evening.,0
"It was odd, perhaps even blatant, that later that evening Sam said to Gladys:",0
"You know that Ava needs a dress and I hope you don’t mind, I said she could borrow yours.",1
This was a development that Gladys was totally not expecting.,0
What does she need it for?,1
she asked.,0
Didn’t you know she’s going to sing a number with us?,1
said Sam.,0
It's like a reward for arranging everything.,1
What!,1
exclaimed Gladys.,0
"Over my dead body, and even then not in my dress!",1
How dare you invite her without asking me first?,1
"Sorry Gladdy,",1
said Sam.,0
I didn’t realise you would mind so much.,1
"She was nagging me and nagging me, and I just gave in and said ‘alright’.",1
It’s only for one number.,1
"Gladys wanted to cry, but at the same time she felt mean, because she really did have a future making music, and Ava was just a wannabe.",0
She was actually lost for words.,0
"The next day, Ava called at the house to try on the dress.",0
"To tell you the truth,",1
"said Gladys,",0
I think it will be a tight fit for you.,1
"What she said was perfectly true, and she did not mean to be catty, but Ava immediately replied:",0
"I knew you would be like that, but I don’t have any choice because I’m still at school and don’t have any money of my own.",1
Gladys felt bad and said that she was welcome to try it on.,0
"In fact, Ava really had to squeeze into the dress.",0
"When Gladys zipped up her back for her, she wondered if the seams were about to burst.",0
"There,",1
"said Ava, posing in front of the mirror.",0
Sam said it was just made for me.,1
"Gladys shook her head, but Ava did not notice.",0
"On the night of the concert, Gladys and her sisters arrived at the school in a swanky black car.",0
"This sure beats the bus,",1
said Sam. A group of students had been allowed to meet the chiX in their dressing room.,0
Gladys could see how her sisters were loving it.,0
"Of course, I should have known they would have been up for this gig,"" she thought.",0
"They were lapping up the attention because people they had sat next to in class could see how glamorous and successful they had become, and that was somehow even better for their egos than being adored by complete strangers.",0
"There were former school mates who wanted to talk to Gladys too, but there seemed to be a note of sympathy in their voices, because Gladys wasn’t totally famous yet.",0
"It was annoying, but none of her real friends had been given passes to go back stage.",0
She suspected Ava had seen to that.,0
"As ever, Gladys was the one who kept her eye on the time, and coaxed her sisters to get out onto the stage.",0
She stood on the wings and watched the band as the loudest cheers the school had ever heard shook the rafters.,0
The hall throbbed to the bass and drums and there was a delightfully pained look on the face of Mrs Johnson sitting in the front row.,0
Everyone wanted to hear the chiX’s greatest hits like 'Life is a Circus' and 'Ghost Girl' (the sister’s version not Gladys’s) and they were even more up for Laura’s more recent solo numbers.,0
"Gladys thought they weren’t dancing quite as well as they did in their prime, but it was more than good enough for a private gig.",0
"When Ava was about to join them for the last but one song, Laura gave her a great build-up, lavishing praise on her dedication and hard work for charity, and saying how she set a fantastic example for all the selfish people in show business.",0
"Ava was standing in front of Gladys, ready to run on stage, and taking deep calming gulps of air in anticipation of her big moment in the limelight.",0
The borrowed dress seemed to be stretching and Gladys feared that her little favourite black number might be losing its slinky shape.,0
"As Ava stepped on stage, the cheers went up and Gladys’s heart sank.",0
It just did not seem right.,0
"The chiX had given their guest singer an uptempo number, and some verses for her to sing solo.",0
"Gladys had to admit that Ava had a good voice, she was in tune, and she could belt out the notes.",0
Somehow the stitches of her dress clung together.,0
The tight fit sort of flattered her.,0
The final seconds of the song featured some energetic dance steps.,0
Ava swung her hips and - Kapow!,0
"The dress actually did go bust - Gladys's first reaction was horror at seeing her favourite item in her wardrobe fall to pieces, but then she burst out laughing because the school’s head girl was standing on the stage in her underwear.",0
"She was so stunned she did not move for a moment, before the full horror of what had just happened sunk in and she ran off stage.",0
"The audience found her predicament hilarious, and suddenly it wasn’t a Christmas concert so much as a comedy ball.",0
"I’ve never been so embarrassed in all my life,",1
hissed Ava through hot tears.,0
And it’s all your fault for lending me a cheap knock-off of a dress.,1
Didn’t I try to warn you?,1
"asked Gladys, amazed at the A grade student’s reasoning, or lack of it.",0
She was already feeling torn between sympathy and feeling this was the funniest thing she had ever seen.,0
The music had stopped and Laura was speaking to the audience:,0
"I hope you enjoyed your head girl’s deliberate wardrobe malfunction, which was of course all part of the act, and now please put your hands together and welcome the unsung hero of our singing sisterhood.",1
"We’ve always called her the brainy one of the family, but actually she’s also got an amazingly sweet voice and my prediction for the New Year is that she’s going to be a huge star - give it up for the one and only Gladys!",1
Gladys was so amazed that her feet felt like they were glued to the floor.,0
Laura had to come and drag her onto the stage and place her in front of Ava’s microphone.,0
"The drummer started to beat out a groove and Gladys recognised the number, because she had suggested it as the finale to the show.",0
She glanced at Laura and saw her affectionate smile that said:,0
"""Go ahead and sing, you know the words,",0
"When Bertie was a prince, he won a prize for being the kingdom’s most courteous driver.",0
The wicked queen thought that he looked ridiculous waiting at the lights in his ordinary car.,0
She was more furious than ever that her daughter wanted to marry such a pathetic prince.,0
She thought that the best way to unimpress Princess Beatrice with Bertie was to arrange a driving holiday.,0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration nineteen.one.,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth.  As you probably know, there is a tadpole who lives in the palace pond with Bertie, and his name is Tim. All day long, he likes to swim around asking no end of questions;",0
"and if nobody answers his question, he asks it again, and again, and again.",0
He’s always got some question on his mind.,0
"For example, this morning, when Bertie was sitting on a stone, Tim popped his pin-sized head out of the water and asked:",0
"Bertie, can you drive a car?",1
"As sometimes happens, Colin the Carp was eavesdropping, and he could not resist butting in with:",0
"Oh yes, little Tim. It’s every frog that can drive a car.",1
"In fact, some frogs are taxi drivers.",1
"In fact, before tadpoles can grow up to be frogs, they have to pass a driving test.",1
In fact...,1
Colin couldn’t think of another,0
"In fact,",1
so Tim said:,0
Oh really?,1
That’s jolly interesting.,1
Then he thought for a bit while he swam once around the pond.,0
Nobody was surprised when he swam back with another question:,0
"Bertie, when you were a prince, what sort of car did you drive?",1
And this time Bertie answered for himself saying:,0
I bet that you can’t guess.,1
"Oh oh, I like the Guessing Game. Um um, a red Ferrari?",1
"Ah, I know a really good car.",1
"Ah ah, a Porsche.",1
"Oh, oh, don’t tell me.",1
Ah ah...,1
"But Tim had to give up, because he couldn’t remember the names of any more cars.",0
And so Bertie told him that the car he used to drive when he was a prince was a...,0
"Ford. Tim was awfully impressed – but nobody else was, because although Fords are fine cars in many ways, they are cars that, well, ordinary people drive, not princes.",0
Not usually anyway.,0
But Tim could hardly contain himself with excitement now that he had learned the name of a new car.,0
The only way that Bertie could stop his flood of questions was to tell a story.,0
And this is what he told...,0
"As soon as Prince Bertie was old enough to drive, he asked his father, the king, for a car.",0
"The king did not really approve of cars, or any type of machine really, apart from steam trains, which he liked a lot.",0
"But Bertie kept on asking and asking, until eventually the king agreed that he could have one of the cars that were parked in the palace garage.",0
He didn’t really mind which car Bertie took.,0
"But the wicked queen did, however, Because, you see, she loved cars, and the faster and the more expensive, the better.",0
And so she told the garage man to give Bertie the slowest and the oldest.,0
"Now Bertie and the garage man had known each other for a long, long time.",0
He often used to come down to the garage to watch his friend mend the cars.,0
"When Bertie came to collect his car, the garage man scratched his head and said:",0
It doesn’t really seem right that a royal prince should have an old car like this.,1
I’ll tell you what.,1
I’ll soup it up a bit.,1
"And over the next month, whenever he had a little spare time, he worked on Bertie’s car and added some special features – like an extra super fast engine, and a frame to make it stronger, in case it rolled over in a rally race, and bullet proof glass just in case anybody tried to assassinate Prince Bertie.",0
thought Bertie as he drove without an instructor for first time.,0
He pushed his foot down on the accelerator pedal.,0
"This car doesn’t look like much on the outside, but inside there’s a lean, mean racing machine trying to get out.",1
And VROOOOMM!,0
"He went speeding down the road, weaving in and out of traffic, and jumping through lights just as they turned red.",0
"This is terr-if-fic,",1
he said.,0
But that was just before a dog ran across the road right in front of him.,0
"Bertie liked dogs, and certainly did not want to run it over, but there was no time to break and so he swerved to the left.",0
"The tyre hit the curb and he went bouncing back out into the road, and only just missed the dog.",0
"He had totally lost control now, and the car was just driving itself.",0
A mother was pushing her pram along the other side of the pavement towards him.,0
The car was skidding diagonally towards them.,0
"It mounted the pavement, and just went past the pram.",0
It carried on ploughing through two or three front gardens and ended up in a hedge.,0
"As the car crashed to a halt, Bertie lurched forward but his seatbelt stopped him going too far.",0
An airbag blew up in front of his nose.,0
"The first thing he heard was the mother of the baby that he had almost killed, saying:",0
Are you alright?,1
Shall I call an ambulance?,1
And Prince Bertie kept his promise.,0
He even won an award for being the kingdom’s most courteous driver.,0
But the wicked queen was anything but a courteous driver.,0
"If anyone dared to cut in front of her, or worse, give her a speeding ticket or a parking fine, she turned them into a beetle.",0
"As she sped through the red traffic lights, she thought that Prince Bertie looked quite silly as he waited at the white line.",0
"She hated the fact that her daughter, the lovely Princess Beatrice, wanted to marry such a namby-pamby, handbreak on, gear in neutral, nincompoop.",0
And so she decided that the best way to unimpress Beatrice with Bertie was to go on a driving holiday.,0
"At the start of the summer, the wicked queen sat at the wheel of her low slung, pointy-nosed, sleek black speed machine.",0
Bertie opened the door of his Ford and helped Princess Beatrice with her seat belt.,0
"They took the road to the next door kingdom, and once they were across the border, they headed for the mountains.",0
"The queen had arranged for them to stop for the night with her cousin, who lived in a castle on a high mountain pass.",0
"She would have arrived hours before Bertie and Beatrice, only the police pulled her over for speeding.",0
Do you want me to turn you into a cockroach?,1
She asked the police officer.,0
"But she was in a foreign land now, and the officials were not afraid of her.",0
"She thought she had better not do anything too wicked, in case she started a war between the two countries.",0
They arrived at the castle towards nightfall.,0
Its white towers and pointy red roofs guarded the valley from the top of a wall of rock.,0
Prince Dracula would not have been ashamed to live there.,0
"But its current owner, Prince Vlad, did not look at all like a vampire.",0
He was a small man with a little blonde moustache.,0
"It was hard to see any family resemblance to his cousin, the wicked queen.",0
And Bertie thought:,0
"He’s obviously sweet like Beatrice, and not at all wicked like her mother.",1
"As it was late, they sat down to dinner in the great hall of the castle.",0
The first course was wild boar pâté.,0
"Unfortunately, Princess Beatrice could not eat it because she was a vegetarian.",0
"Oh dear, I’m so hungry,",1
she whispered to Bertie. The second course was a fondue.,0
A fondue is a mountain dish which you cook yourself at the table.,0
Beatrice was pleased when she saw the servant set up the fondue and light the flame below it.,0
She loved fondues.,0
"At home, they would prong bits of bread with a skewer, and dip them in a cheese sauce which was melted over the heat.",0
"If you lost your bread, you had to do a forfeit, like sing a song or say something silly about yourself.",0
"This will be fun,",1
she said to Bertie. The servant lifted the lid of the silver serving dish.,0
But oh no.,0
This wasn’t a cheese fondue.,0
It was raw meat.,0
The queen quickly pronged a piece with her skewer and popped it into her mouth without cooking it.,0
Beatrice was so disappointed.,0
"Excuse me,",1
she said to Prince Vlad.,0
Could you ask them to bring me some cheese and perhaps some celery?,1
"You see, I’m vegetarian.",1
Prince Vlad looked quite astonished.,0
He clearly did not expect to entertain a vegetarian in his castle.,0
"I know,",1
said the queen to her cousin.,0
Pathetic isn’t it?,1
And Prince Vlad said:,0
"Well she looks like a horse, so it’s hardly surprising that she eats grass.",1
said Bertie.,0
How dare you say that about Beatrice?,1
How dare I?,1
Said Prince Vlad.,0
"This is my castle, and I can say what I want to.",1
"Well I jolly well think you should say you’re sorry,",1
"said Bertie. At the word,",0
"sorry,",1
"Prince Vlad’s little moustache twitched, and his ears went red.",0
His eyes swivelled this way and that.,0
It was clearly a word that he didn’t like  much.,0
Sorry?,1
He said under his breath.,0
Then he said louder:,0
I shall give you my apologies with a bullet at dawn.,1
I challenge you to a duel!,1
"Alright,",1
said Bertie.,0
Oh no!,1
Stop it.,1
Stop it!,1
Exclaimed Beatrice.,0
Oh goodie!,1
"Said the queen, because she loved duels, and she thought her cousin Vlad was bound to win and shoot Bertie, and that would be the end of her problem.",0
Beatrice could hold back her tears no longer.,0
She ran out of the room sobbing.,0
Bertie caught up with her down the corridor.,0
"This is too silly,",1
said Beatrice. I absolutely forbid you to take part in this duel.,0
You know he’ll cheat.,0
Your pistol probably won’t even be loaded.,0
In fact..,0
"in fact I won’t marry you if you fight this duel, even if he doesn’t kill you.",0
What have I done?,1
He asked.,0
"You were driving too slowly,",1
said the policeman.,0
Bertie laughed.,0
Beatrice leaned over and told the policeman:,0
No he wasn’t.,1
He was driving normally.,1
Then the policeman said:,0
You are under arrest for running away from a duel.,1
You must return to the castle of Prince Vladimir.,1
"You were right,",1
said Bertie to Beatrice.,0
It’s all a trick.,1
Prince Vlad just wants to kill me.,1
The wicked queen put him up to this to stop me marrying you.,1
What shall we do?,1
Asked Beatrice.,0
"This,",1
"said Bertie, and he pulled the car out and accelerated down the mountain road.",0
The policemen jumped onto their motorcycles and started to give chase.,0
"Beatrice covered her face with terror because she was certain that Bertie would shoot off the road at the first bend and they would go hurtling thousands of feet to their deaths – but he took it perfectly, and he rounded the second corner like a rally driver.",0
"You see, what Bertie hadn’t told anyone, was that every weekend he took his car to the racing track and practiced driving it fast.",0
"But by the time they were on a straight piece of road, the motorcycles were catching up with them.",0
Bertie pressed a button on the dashboard and the car shot forward even faster than before.,0
Still the motorcycles were keeping up.,0
"By the next bend, one of them was trying to overtake.",0
"But it was still early morning, and the road was slippery with dew.",0
Bertie’s car went into a spin.,0
He steered into the skid as he had been taught and managed to take it around in a perfect circle and carry on driving.,0
The policemen had to drive off the road to avoid him.,0
"Fortunately for them, it wasn’t too steep here and they both went speeding over the green pastures, unable to stop until they were nearly at the bottom of the valley.",0
It wasn’t far to the border now.,0
"When they reached the barrier, Bertie just went crashing straight through it.",0
"The border guards opened fire, and it was a good thing that the windows of Bertie’s car were bullet proof.",0
He sped through no-man’s land and slowed down just before the crossing into the next country.,0
Beatrice and Bertie waved their royal passports at the two guards and they reached safety.,0
Bertie and Beatrice drove calmly on to their destination:,0
"the summer palace of Princess Leone, which overlooked the sparkling blue sea.",0
The wicked queen arrived three days later.,0
"You see, first she lost the way, and then her car had broken down.",0
But what annoyed her more than anything was that she soon saw that Bertie and Beatrice were more in love than ever.,0
"A few summers ago, when Bertie was still a human prince and lived in the palace, he was just a little bit bored because the only thing his father, the king, would talk about was his annual garden party.",0
"The theme that year was to be,",0
"Sweet Smells,",1
and all the sweetest smelling people in the kingdom were to be invited.,0
"Most of them were girls, as it turned out.",0
"There were to be sweet smelling flowers with sweet smelling blossom, and the most fragrant honey, and different types of aromatic teas - and the gardeners were busy clearing all the green slime out of the pond and pouring perfume and aftershave into it to make it smell nicer.",0
"Colin the Carp wasn’t at all pleased, but Bertie didn’t know him then - and Tim the Tadpole wasn’t even born.",0
"In those days, Bertie had yet to set eyes upon the lovely Princess Beatrice. She and her wicked stepmother still lived in a far away place called Wales. I think I told you about that once before.",0
"Well if truth be told, there was a bit of a stinky whiff wafting around the castle where Beatrice lived with her stepmother.",0
"It was suffering from blocked drains, you see, and that summer they were very blocked indeed.",0
The newspapers reported that the lovely Princess Beatrice was going around with a clothes peg on her nose.,0
"At first, when Bertie’s father read about this, he almost laughed his head off.",0
"""I was planning to invite the lovely Princess Beatrice to my garden party,"" he said,",0
"but I don’t think I had better risk it, because she probably pongs to high heaven.",1
"When the wicked queen heard about this insult, she was furious.",0
"""So that stupid old king thinks my daughter smells does he?",0
"Well before the summer’s out we’ll see who’s the biggest stinker of them all."" So the wicked queen commanded all the top scientists, wizards, and druids in Wales to concoct the stinkiest, foulest, most pungent pong ever created, and then, to load the pong into a rocket.",0
"When this was done, she gave a note to her ambassador to deliver to Bertie’s father.",0
It read:,0
"""Invite or stink!"" When he received this note, Bertie’s farther flew into a frightful rage:",0
"He stood up from his throne and railed at the ambassador,",0
"Kindly inform that malign, maledictive, malodorous, queen of yours that we don’t give into blackmail here, or even to 'stink mail.' She and her smelly daughter aren’t invited to my party, so there!"" But at night he couldn’t sleep for worrying about the stink bomb landing on his summer garden party, and all his fragrant guests being covered in foul-smelling sewage, or whatever the wicked queen meant to drop on them.",0
"That’s why Prince Bertie, who was hanging around the palace looking just a bit bored, was summoned.",0
"The king sent him to Wales on a top secret mission to 'Stop the Stink.' Bertie had to choose a disguise, and he decided upon a travelling jester.",0
"Bertie arrived at the wicked queen’s castle, and presented himself as an entertainer, who wondered the highways and byways on his skateboard, telling funny stories and performing clever tricks.",0
"That evening after dinner, he was invited before the royal family.",0
Bertie did a little dance and shook his floppy hat with a bell on the end.,0
"Then he made a bow, and waited for a ripple of warm, welcoming applause.",0
The king yawned.,0
"Bertie saw this, and his mind went blank - even more so than usual - and he couldn’t remember a single joke, even though he was usually brimming with them.",0
"After about half a minute’s silence, the wicked queen said, ",0
He’s useless.,1
Dump him in the dungeon.,1
"Hey, have you heard this one?",1
Called out Bertie.,0
What sort of dog doesn’t smell?,0
One without a nose.,0
Ha Ha!,0
"Can you say Iced Ink very fast several time over?"" The lovely Princess Beatrice said, ",0
Oh please don’t take him away.,1
"He’s rather sweet, even if his jokes aren’t really that funny.",1
"Meanwhile, the king was muttering to himself,",0
"Iced ink Iced ink, I stink.",1
"Ha ha ha, You said you stink!",1
Called back Bertie.,0
"Take him away,",1
said the queen in a very bored voice.,0
I believe cell number five is free.,1
The last unfunny idiot who was in that one departed yesterday...,1
May his soul rest in peace.,1
"The guards took Bertie to the prison in the cellars of the castle, opened up a hatch in the floor, and pushed him in.",0
"Down down down, he fell.",0
"Oh no, this place is very dark and there’s a funny smell.",1
I wonder how far I’m going to fall?,1
Thought Bertie - and then Boing!,0
"He landed on an old bed, and the legs immediately collapsed.",0
But at least he wasn’t too hurt.,0
All he could see was a little shaft of moonlight from a window near the top of the cell.,0
"Around midnight, a guard opened the hatch and called out,",0
dinner.,1
"He dropped down a cold, half eaten burger and a carton of orange drink.",0
"Enjoy your Big Value Meal Deal,",1
called out the guard.,0
Sorry I ate half your burger and all of your apple pie.,1
"Oh dear,",1
"said Bertie. ""I should have told them the joke about the man who went to the doctor and said he felt like a parrot...",0
That one always makes everybody laugh.,0
Now I’m going stay in this dungeon until I rot and die.,0
Oh I wish I had never become a secret agent.,0
"It’s not nearly as much fun as it sounds."" Towards morning, when it was just getting light again outside, he felt something tickling his nose.",0
Is that a mouse?,1
"He thought, and then he heard a sweet little voice whispering,",0
"Jester, oh Jester, Please wake up.",1
A mouse that talks?,1
Thought Bertie. But then he realised that the voice was coming from up above.,0
"He rubbed his eyes, and saw that it wasn’t a mouse that was tickling his nose, but a silk rope dangling from the hatch door.",0
"Quick. Climb up,",1
"whispered the voice, which he now recognised as belonging to the lovely Princess Beatrice. Quick as he could, Bertie shinned up the silk rope and out through the hatch.",0
"Beatrice quickly untied the other end at the window bars, and they ran out before the guard came back from the changing room.",0
Beatrice led Bertie out of the castle and onto the dewy grass of the king’s daffodil garden.,0
"Bertie looked gratefully at the lovely Princess Beatrice and said,",0
"Now I know that the you are the bravest and cleverest princess in the entire world, as well as the loveliest.",1
"Well don’t tell anyone or I’ll be in super big trouble,",1
said Beatrice. Bertie promised not to tell a soul.,0
"She led him down the path to a secret gate in the wall, but as Bertie was about to go through it, he remembered that he had come to Wales on a mission.",0
He wondered if he could let Beatrice into his secret.,0
"She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and said,",0
"Now jester, you’d better be off before we both get caught.",1
"I don’t mean to shock you,",1
"said Bertie,",0
but I’m not a jester - not really.,1
Really?,1
"I’d never have guessed,",1
said Beatrice sarcastically.,0
Your jokes were so side-splittingly hilarious.,1
"Bertie was about to tell her the truth - that in fact he was a secret agent, and that he had come to stop her wicked stepmother firing a rocket full of foul-smelling sewage onto his father’s summer garden party.",0
"But at that moment they heard a terrible voice screech out,",0
There they are!,1
Seize them!,1
And they were surrounded by snarling dogs.,0
"The wicked queen, still in her dressing gown, said,",0
"Well well well, Romeo and Juliet.",1
Two whole days went past.,0
Bertie sat in darkness at the bottom of the dungeon.,0
"He knew that it was the date of his father’s garden party, that he had failed miserably in his mission, that all the sweetest smelling people in his home kingdom would be covered in foul smelling sewage, and that he would finish his days, forgotten by all (even the lovely Beatrice), in that terrible dark prison cell.",0
"He felt, well, quite a bit down about that.",0
"But when the time came, the wicked queen could not resist sending for Bertie so that he could witness her rocket take off on its way to way to deliver its terrible stink to its target.",0
The soldiers led Bertie into the garden.,0
His wrists were handcuffed behind his back.,0
Every exit was guarded.,0
"The rocket stood on the launch pad along side the tallest tower of the castle, ready for lift off.",0
"The lovely Beatrice was sitting next to the king, on a golden throne that had been set up in the orchard.",0
She was stroking her pet bunny rabbit and sobbing into her handkerchief.,0
The king was reading the gardening column in his newspaper.,0
The wicked queen was wearing a yellow safety helmet and standing on top of a temporary platform.,0
The guards brought the prisoner up to stand beside her.,0
"My dear jester, or should I call you Prince Bertie?",1
Snarled the Queen.,0
How lovely to see you.,1
I thought you might like to laugh along with me at this little joke I’m about to play on your father.,1
"Ha Ha,",1
said Bertie - but he didn’t mean it.,0
At the same time he was wriggling with his hands behind his back to see if he could slip out of the handcuffs.,0
Soon after the queen began to count down backwards.,0
"ten, nine, eight...",1
Her terrible voice echoed around the walls of the castle.,0
Even the king looked up from his newspaper.,0
Bertie kept on wriggling his hands.,0
"He hadn’t eaten for two whole days, and he felt like he was all skin and bones.",0
Surely he was thin enough to escape?,0
"seven, six, five, four...",1
" Bertie’s eye was on a red button on the queen’s control Panel. It said,",0
Abort.,1
"If only he could press that button at the right moment, the rocket would stop its mission.",0
"three, two, one...",1
Blast off!,1
 Screeched the queen.,0
"Slowly the rocket started to rise from the launch pad, pushed upwards by a great ball of flames.",0
"Everyone in the palace applauded, except for Bertie, whose hands were cuffed, and Beatrice, who was still stroking her bunny rabbit.",0
"The queen started to shout, ""Stink!",0
Stink!,0
"Stink!"" Then all the people joined in shouting, ""Stink!",0
Stink!,0
"Stink!"" And Bertie kept on wriggling his hands.",0
"Everyone’s eyes, including those of the queen and all the guards were glued to the sight of the rocket hovering just above the castle, before setting on its way to deliver its terrible smells to Bertie’s kingdom.",0
Suddenly Bertie felt his hand slip out of the cuff.,0
His now free hand shot out and hit the red,0
Abort,1
button.,0
"It started to flash and beep and the queen shrieked,",0
Who did that?,1
She manically pressed the button marked,0
Start,1
but it was too late.,0
"The rocket stopped in mid air and came crashing down onto the roof of the castle, from where it rolled into the garden below, landing right the middle of the king’s prize daffodils.",0
There was an almighty explosion and the air was filled with sewage flying in all directions.,0
Everyone was covered in it.,0
Bertie started to run.,0
"The guards were far too busy holding their noses and saying,",0
"Poo, what a pong!",1
To notice him jumping into the king’s Rolls Royce and speeding off down the drive.,0
"Bertie drove and drove, taking a secret road through the mountains, until he reached home.",0
"He was just in time for last part of his father’s garden party, which had been a sweet-smelling success, untroubled by stink bombs.",0
As he walked through the crowds the guests held their noses.,0
Is that Prince Bertie?,1
They whispered to one another.,0
He doesn’t half pong.,1
"Bertie,",1
shouted his father when he smelled him.,0
"Go and take a bath, immediately.",1
"But, but, I saved you from the stink bomb,",1
said Bertie.,0
"Right this minute,",1
shouted his father.,0
So Agent Bertie had no choice but to go and take a bath.,0
"The problem with being a secret agent,",1
"he thought, as he soaked among the soap bubbles,",0
Is that your mission is so secret that nobody knows how jolly brave you were.,1
"But the lovely Princess Beatrice knew how brave he was - and although she and her bunny rabbit were covered in bad smelling stuff, she didn’t mind that much, because at last she had met a prince who had got the better of her wicked stepmother.",0
And that’s the story of Agent Bertie.,0
"Mum and Dad are going away for a romantic weekend, and",0
Wicked,1
Uncle Jeff is left in charge of the children.,0
"The children have homework to do, but Uncle Jeff thinks that is far too boring.",0
"He has other ideas, and a misadventure follows.",0
Story by Bertie Read by Natasha. Duration sixteen.forty-six.,0
Proofread by Jana Elizabeth,0
"Well I suppose I could ask Jeff,",1
said Dad.,0
"Oh no, anybody but Jeff,",1
"said Mum. But as it turned out, there was nobody else but Jeff to be found at such short notice.",0
Jeff was Dad’s brother.,0
"The children hadn’t seen him since they were very small, and Mum called him their",0
wicked Uncle,1
because he always forgot their birthdays.,0
Sometimes he sent cards and a ten pound note – but always at completely the wrong time of year.,0
"I bet he is awfully wicked,",1
"said Jemima,",0
because Mum really really doesn’t like him at all.,1
I think he went to prison.,1
Or perhaps he was a pirate.,1
said Jeremy hopefully.,0
"But when Jemima asked Dad if Uncle Jeff had been to prison, Dad said that no he hadn’t, at least, not as far as he knew.",0
But he didn’t say it like he was surprised she had asked.,0
"I mean, if somebody asked you if somebody you knew had been to prison, you might at least try to sound a bit surprised.",0
But Dad didn’t.,0
"Uncle Jeff arrived late on Friday night, and in the morning, when Jeremy looked out of the window he saw a red sports car parked in the drive next to Dad’s big blue estate car.",0
A taxi came very early to pick up Mum and Dad and take them to the airport.,0
"Later, Jemima and Jeremy got up and made their own breakfast, but Jeremy didn’t eat his at the kitchen table like he was supposed to.",0
"Instead, still in his pyjamas, he took his toast and jam into the living room and switched on the television.",0
"You know that Mum doesn’t let us watch TV on Saturday mornings,",1
said Jemima.,0
because they only show rubbish.,1
Well Mum isn’t here.,1
"She’s enjoying a weekend of freedom from us,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"I bet Uncle Jeff will tick you off,",1
"said Jemima. At about about ten o’clock, Uncle Jeff came into the living room just as an army of tanks was being destroyed by robots from the Planet Zeeton.",0
Bang!,1
Pehow!,1
Poook!,1
"said Uncle Jeff, like a lot of guns and explosives going off.",0
Jeremy looked up at him in amazement.,0
Dad never said anything like that.,0
"Scuse me kids,",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
I need a cup of strong black coffee before I can face the world – Now where’s the kitchen?,1
"Oh, I’m your Uncle Jeff by the way,",1
and he disappeared down the corridor.,0
"A little later, he returned and asked,",0
Well what are we going to do today?,1
"Homework,",1
"said Jemima. And Uncle Jeff said,",0
Bor-ing.,1
What’s the world coming to?,1
Don’t kids these days get up to any mischief?,1
Let’s go and buy some computer games,1
suggested Jeremy.,0
"Could do,",1
said Uncle Jeff thoughtfully.,0
But I had something a bit more outdoors in mind.,1
Come on.,1
Get dressed and I’ll take you on a surprise treat.,1
"A little later, they all got into Dad’s estate car.",0
"Jeremy was supposed to be strapped into a child seat for safety, but he asked cheekily,",0
can I drive?,1
"and Uncle Jeff said,",0
"well alright, but only on the driveway.",1
"Jemima protested that her little brother didn’t know how to drive a car, but Uncle Jeff said that it was never too early to learn, and he let Jeremy sit on his lap and hold the steering wheel.",0
"But just as Jeff was starting the engine, Jeremy moved the gear stick, and the car leapt forward with a great crunching noise.",0
There was a burning smell and smoke started to come out of the bonnet.,0
"Whoops, there goes the clutch,",1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
I don’t think Dennis is going to be too pleased.,1
Perhaps we won’t mention this little incident to your dad.,1
We’ll just let him think that your mother broke the car.,1
"Well, what shall we do now?",1
Can we go in your sports car?,1
asked Jeremy.,0
"Well, so long as I drive,",1
said Uncle Jeff. And they all got out and went over to Uncle Jeff’s car.,0
"It was rather cramped in the back seat, even for the children, and there certainly wasn’t room for Jeremy’s safety seat.",0
"He reversed out of the drive at quite a pace, and soon was roaring down their street so that all of their neighbours must have heard them.",0
Then Uncle Jeff turned on some loud music and opened the sun roof.,0
His style of driving was not at all like Dad’s.,0
He zipped in and out of traffic and shot through lights just as they were turning from orange to red.,0
"Jemima thought he was an irresponsible driver, but she didn’t say anything because that wouldn’t be polite.",0
"Jeremy said,",0
can we go faster Uncle Jeff?,1
And Uncle Jeff put his foot on the pedal and they went even faster.,0
"He took them out of town, and down a dual carriageway into the countryside.",0
Eventually he turned up to what looked like a farm track.,0
A sign read:,0
Clay Pigeon Shooting.,1
"When they stopped and got out of the car, Uncle Jeff opened up the little boot and took out a long leather pouch.",0
Jeremy realised that there was a gun inside.,0
"Oh, can I hold it?",1
he asked.,0
And Uncle Jeff said,0
Maybe.,1
"Clay Pigeons aren’t real pigeons, but disks that are shot out of a machine and fly through the air.",0
If you are shooting you try to smash the disk.,0
"But it’s extremely difficult to hit a moving target, and requires lots of skill.",0
Uncle Jeff made sure that Jeremy and Jemima were kitted out with ear protectors because gun-fire is really loud and can make you deaf.,0
They also had to wear goggles in case a bit of clay flew into their eyes.,0
They stood in a field and when Uncle Jeff called,0
pull,1
a clay pigeon flew out of a kind of bunker.,0
Uncle Jeff smoothly followed the target with his gun and squeezed the trigger.,0
There was a loud bang and the smell of gun powder in the air.,0
He missed.,0
But he called out,0
pull,1
again and another target flew through the air.,0
This time he hit it and the clay smashed into pieces.,0
Can I have a go?,1
Can I have a go?,1
begged Jeremy. And Uncle Jeff showed him how to hold the shotgun broken open at the middle so that it couldn’t go off by accident.,0
And then he showed him how to hold it in firing position so that its kick wouldn’t hurt his shoulder.,0
"The shot gun was almost as big as Jeremy, but he thought that holding it was the coolest thing ever.",0
Pull,1
"he shouted, and a pigeon flew through the air.",0
He followed it and squeezed the trigger.,0
The gun went,0
boom,1
and it jumped as if it had a life of its own.,0
Jeremy missed by a mile.,0
"But he was very excited, and as soon as Uncle Jeff had loaded a new cartridge into the barrel, he called",0
pull,1
again and another pigeon flew through the air and he missed one more time.,0
"In fact, however many times he tried, Jeremy couldn’t hit the target.",0
And then Jemima had a go.,0
And do you know what?,0
She was really good at shooting.,0
She smashed the target about four or five times.,0
Even Uncle Jeff was impressed.,0
"Better than doing homework, eh?",1
he said as they squished back into his car.,0
Jeremy and Jemima thanked their uncle for their treat.,0
"It was really wicked,",1
said Jeremy.,0
"Well it was fun,",1
said Jemima.,0
But I don’t think you should have taken us clay pigeon shooting without asking Mum first.,1
How do you know I didn’t ask her?,1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
Because she would almost certainly have said ,0
said Jemima.,0
"And by the way, please drive more slowly and carefully.",1
"There are children in the back, you are the responsible adult.",1
Uncle Jeff slowed down and promised to drive carefully.,0
And Jemima felt better because she realised that safety was even more important than being polite or worrying about causing offence.,0
"When they got back to town, Uncle Jeff took them to a Turkish Kebab restaurant for lunch, and Jeremy tried hot chilli sauce which burnt his mouth.",0
He had to eat loads of ice cream afterwards to cool off.,0
"But when they got back to the house, Uncle Jeff searched in vain through his pockets for the front door key.",0
And then he realized that he must have got it mixed up with his own from home.,0
They were locked out.,0
It’s a pity.,1
I think I’m too heavy to climb onto that roof,1
said Uncle Jeff.,0
"But I can,",1
"said Jeremy. And since there was no other way into the house, Uncle Jeff agreed to lift Jeremy up onto the roof of the porch.",0
He started to scramble up towards the window.,0
"But when he got to it, he found that the window was stuck and he couldn’t get it open any more.",0
"But there was a higher window that was fully open, and Jeremy thought that he might be able to climb up to that one by getting up onto the garden wall.",0
Oh no,1
called out Uncle Jeff when he saw what Jeremy was trying to do.,0
That’s too dangerous,1
But Jeremy didn’t listen.,0
He was on the top of the garden wall and now he was trying to stretch across to the high window.,0
But the stretch was too far and he didn’t make it.,0
He fell down to the roof of the porch.,0
The extension to the house hadn’t been made very well by the builders and Jeremy went straight through the roof of the sun room.,0
He landed on top of Mum’s tomato plant.,0
said Jeremy.,0
"Oh dear,",1
said Jeff.,0
"I don’t think Mum’s going to be pleased,",1
said Jemima. A nosy neighbour saw what had happened and called the police.,0
He told them:,0
"There’s a boy who’s just got in through the roof, and a man holding what can only be a gun.",1
Then there’s a lass too.,1
She looks really mean.,1
What makes you say it’s a gun sir?,1
asked the policeman.,0
"Well I was in the army for fifteen years and I think I know what a gun looks like,",1
said the neighbour.,0
It wasn’t often that people with guns tried to break into houses in that area.,0
"In fact, Jeremy and Jemima lived on one of the sleepiest and most peaceful streets you could imagine.",0
But the police officer who took the call decided to send an armed response unit just to be on the safe side.,0
It took Jeremy a few minutes to get over the shock of falling through the roof.,0
"He wasn’t badly hurt, but he had cut and bruised himself and he had earth in his hair and looked quite a sight.",0
The police car screeched up the drive just as he was letting Uncle Jeff and Jemima in through the front door.,0
"Armed Police Officers, Freeze!",1
shouted the policeman.,0
And Uncle Jeff said:,0
Don’t shoot.,1
I’ve got a licence for this gun.,1
"Uncle Jeff, Jemima and Jeremy spent the rest of the day at the police station.",0
Jemima and Jeremy were allowed to sit in the waiting room with a policeman and a policewoman sitting on either side of them.,0
They weren’t allowed to talk to each other.,0
Uncle Jeff was taken down to the cells before being interviewed.,0
"He gave them his brother’s mobile phone number, but since Mum and Dad were in Paris on a romantic weekend, they had both turned their mobile phones off for the day.",0
It was ten O’Clock at night before they managed to persuade the police that they weren’t a gang of criminals and could go home.,0
"On Sunday, they all got up rather late.",0
Well what shall we do?,1
asked Uncle Jeff.,0
Homework,1
said Jemima. And Jeremy agreed that they both needed to do their homework.,0
"After that, Jemima asked Jeff if they could make a carrot cake, and they got one of Mum’s recipe books out and they all did the mixing and baking.",0
The result wasn’t too bad.,0
Then they went out and bought some flowers from the stall for Mum and Dad. Then they read books and went to bed at seven o’clock.,0
"Well,",1
said Uncle Jeff to himself as he watched the football match on TV.,0
I think a Wicked Uncle has an important role to play in the upbringing of every child.,1
They won’t forget this weekend in a hurry.,1
I’ve set the kids a great example of how NOT to behave.,1
And he had.,0
"But funnily enough, Mum and Dad never asked him to look after the kids for the weekend again.",0
"Why Cats and Dogs Are Enemies A Story From China, Told by A Mouse. There was a house that I used to visit for my super sometimes.",0
"I knew the way in very well - there was a tiny little door by the back window, so small that you would probably never notice it, but I’m a mouse, and I can squeeze through the teeniest of entrances.",0
"To tell you the truth, the joint was going down hill.",0
"Every time I visited, there were fewer and fewer crumbs.",0
It was hardly worth going there anymore and besides there were dangers.,0
They had a cat.,0
"This cat was getting skinnier and skinnier, and I should have known that he would be on the lookout for a tasty morsel such as me.",0
This is how I got caught.,0
I wasn’t paying enough attention.,0
I got distracted.,0
"Although I have a twitchy nose, I’m not nosy in the other sense of the word.",0
I like to mind my own business.,0
"But one night, I could not help overhearing an argument.",0
The man and the woman of the house were shouting so loud.,0
"It’s all your fault we’re starving,",1
said the woman in a high pitched voice that sounded most distressed.,0
You shouldn’t have gone and sold my mother’s ring behind my back.,1
All you got for it was an old horse that went lame.,1
"Now we’ve got nothing, nothing.",1
What’s your mother’s ring got to do with it?,1
asked the man.,0
"Because I told you a thousand times, the person who wears that ring will never go hungry.",1
"Well I don’t believe in that magic and nonsense,",1
replied the man,0
You don’t believe in anything I say.,1
That’s why you are so thin your trousers keep falling down around your knees.,1
"Ooh, that was quite an argument.",0
But now I understood why the house was getting so poor.,0
The man had sold the magic ring that kept the larder stocked up.,0
"I wish I had a ring like that, I thought.",0
It was all so interesting that I hung around for a fraction too long.,0
That was my big mistake.,0
Everything went black.,0
Am I dead or alive?,1
I thought.,0
But I soon knew that I was alive because I heard a voice that I recognised.,0
"The dog, a scratchy mutt who smelt like a rotting old blanket, was saying:",0
"Hey cat, hang on, don’t eat that mouse just yet.",1
Why shouldn’t I?,1
whined the cat.,0
I haven’t had a decent meal in days.,1
"Neither have I,",1
"said the dog,",0
But the mouse will only satisfy your tum for a few hours.,1
Let’s be smart about this.,1
"He can help us fill our stomachs, and our masters’, for the rest of our days.",1
"Starvation has robbed your good sense,",1
said the cat.,0
"This is a mouse, not a hen.",1
He can’t lay eggs.,1
"No, no no,",1
"woofed the dog,",0
That’s not what I mean.,1
The chief thing about a mouse is that err...,1
he’s small...,1
said the cat.,0
And he can slip through the tiniest of holes...,1
said the cat.,0
"And if we take him to the house where the magic ring is now, he can slip inside and get it for us.",1
"He’ll do this for you, because his life depends on it.",1
I know where that house is.,1
The magpie told me.,1
Let’s head off straight away.,1
The cat saw that the dog was not quite as stupid as he looked.,0
He held me by my tale in his mouth and sprang through the window.,0
The dog followed.,0
Off they both ran down the alleyway.,0
"I was bouncing around all over the place, I can tell you, it was the most horrid way to travel - but hey, I was alive, and that’s usually the main thing.",0
We left the town and reached a river.,0
"The dog said,",0
"Right-oh, in we go!",1
But the cat put me down and held me with a paw.,0
"Not so fast,",1
"she said,",0
I haven’t learnt to swim.,1
"Never mind that, ",0
" woofed the dog, ",0
Jump on my back and I’ll carry you over.,1
Splash!,1
In we all went.,0
"The dog paddled to the other side, and from there it was not far to the house where the ring was to be found.",0
"Inside we could see a man and woman, both plump, with well fed, happy expressions on their faces.The dog said:",0
We’ve come to the right place.,1
Let’s hope she takes the ring off when she goes to bed.,1
The cat prowled round the house looking for a way in.,0
"There’s usually one, if you search hard enough.",0
We found a tiny little hole.,0
"In you go,",1
"she said,",0
And bring back the ring if you value your pathetic little mousey life.,1
"In I went, still glad to be alive, but not too optimistic about finding anything.",0
"I can sniff out crumbs, but mice aren’t equipped with a nose for gold you know.",0
"Fortunately, I saw it glinting in the moonlight.",0
The lady had left it on the table with her other jewellry.,0
They were pretty rich.,0
The man was probably some sort of government official.,0
"I seized the ring in my mouth, and slipped back out again.",0
"Here it is,",1
"I said,",0
I hope you are as good as your word.,1
"Say goodbye to this cruel world, little mouse,",1
"replied the cat, with claws flashing in the moonlight.",0
"I trembled for my life, but the dog woofed:",0
"Stop right there, cat.",0
"We gave our word, and we must keep it.",0
A promise is a promise.,0
"We returned to the river, and swam back as before.",0
Soon we were in the town.,0
"This time, the cat went over the rooftops - while the dog ran down the alleyways.",0
I went home to my nest for a good sleep.,0
Now there is a follow up to this story.,0
"A few weeks later, I was going past the house where the cat and the dog lived.",0
"The light was on, and I looked through the window.",0
"The human couple were having a feast, and the cat, had put on weight.",0
"I thought,",0
It’s true.,1
The owners of the magic ring will never go hungry.,1
"I too deserved a reward for my daring part in the rescue of the ring, and I decided to slip inside and take some crumbs.",0
"But round the back, I found the dog tied up, more miserable than ever.",0
"That’s the story of why cats and dogs are enemies, a traditional tale adapted for Storynory.com by Bertie, and read by me, Natasha. Bertie’s asked me to tell you that there are loads of other stories from all over the world so do drop by soon and listen to some at storynory.cpm And you can always leave a comment and say hello to us.",0
"And if you listen to our latest episodes via the podcast on iTunes or using our app, please find a moment to leave a comment in iTunes and say something nice about us.",0
"For now,",0
"Katie the ordinary witch, loses her spell book at school.",0
"This is bad enough, but then somebody starts using her spells to play tricks.",0
"Of course when magic happens at school, it’s only natural that people blame Katie. She must become a detective and discover who the thief is before things go too far.",0
"But just once, she took it to school to show to her friend Isis. She let Isis have a very quick look, so that she could see how all her spells were written in beautiful letters, and how she drew pictures to explain the difficult parts.",0
"And then, as the geography class was about to begin, she quickly slipped the book into her bag with her other books.",0
"Normally she would have made all the writing inside it invisible, but it was against the rules to do magic at school, and she didn’t want anyone to hear her saying the invisible spell.",0
But please Miss Vile?,1
Katie. Answering back is holding everyone up and putting them in danger.,1
Just put the bag back and follow the procedure.,1
"And although Katie thought it was a waste of time to put her bag back on the desk, she did as she was told.",0
There wasn’t really a fire.,0
It was just a practice.,0
And soon everyone was allowed back inside to continue with their lessons.,0
"It was only later that evening, when Katie got home and took out all her books, that she realised that the most important one of all was missing.",0
At first she couldn’t quite believe it.,0
She looked through all her books again and again.,0
But no.,0
The spell book wasn’t among them.,0
And then she thought back through the day.,0
The Fire Drill!,1
she said out loud to herself.,0
That was the only time the bag was out of my sight.,1
Somebody must have stolen my book!,1
"And although she was very worried, she didn’t tell her mother because she knew she would be cross.",0
Instead she said to herself:,0
I’ll just have to be a detective and discover who took it!,1
"The next day, the whole class had to do a spelling test.",0
"Not a magic spelling test, but the ordinary sort where you have to write down tricky words.",0
"At the end, the children had to swap books with their neighbour and mark each others’ tests.",0
Katie marked Isis’s book.,0
And do you know what?,0
She scored ten out of ten.,0
And Katie thought:,0
Nobody could know how to spell all of those horrible words.,1
She must have cheated with magic.,1
Isis must have stolen my spell book!,1
And as soon as the bell rang for the end of class she turned to Isis and demanded:,0
All right.,1
Hand it over!,1
Hand over what?,1
You know perfectly well what.,1
My spell book.,1
You stole it yesterday during the fire drill!,1
And Isis looked like she was going to cry.,0
Katie. How could you say such a nasty thing.,1
I’m your friend.,1
"And besides, I left for the drill before you and came back after you.",1
"So if anyone stole your book, it wasn’t me.",1
And Katie remembered that it was true.,0
"Isis had left before her, and come back after her, so it couldn’t have been her that stole her book.",0
"Yes, that’s right,",1
she said.,0
I’m sorry I accused you.,1
But who could have taken my book?,1
"I know who,",1
said Isis.,0
"It was Isabelle. When you were showing me your book, she was kind of hovering around, pretending not to be interested.",1
But she’s a nosy parker and she was listening in.,1
She’s the one who took your book.,1
I bet.,1
"Katie and Isis decided not to accuse Isabelle right away, because then she would be on her guard.",0
Instead they watched her closely to see if she gave herself away.,0
"The very next day, Isis came into class very excitedly and whispered into Katie’s ear:",0
Have you seen Isabelle yet?,1
She’s smiling all over her criminal little face.,1
Mrs Hepworth has said that she can go on holiday for two weeks during term time.,1
"Her Dad is going to California for his work, and he’s going to take the family with him to see Disneyland. Mrs Hepworth never lets anyone take time off school.",1
Isabelle must have put a spell on her.,1
And Katie was sure that her friend was right.,0
But then it turned out that it was all a mistake.,0
"Isabelle’s Dad had promised to take her to Disneyland, but he hadn’t asked Mrs Hepworth, who was the head teacher.",0
"And when he did ask her, she said:",0
No. Not under any circumstances can Mickey Mouse be more important than mathematics.,1
And Isabelle didn’t go to Disneyland with her family.,0
So it couldn’t have been Isabelle who stole the spell book.,0
And then some strange things started to happen around school.,0
Mr Cotton liked to put his gloves on the table.,0
"One time when he turned his back to write on the white board, the glove started to walk across the table on two fingers.",0
When he turned round it flopped down again.,0
"The whole class started laughing, and Mr Cotton said:",0
All right.,1
Will somebody let me in on the big joke?,1
And Moyra said:,0
Katie did a spell!,1
And Katie would have been in big trouble.,0
"Only Mr Cotton was nice and didn’t tell Mrs Hepworth. And another time, when Mr Corneau was teaching french, a marker pen drew funny faces on the white board behind his back.",0
Everyone laughed again.,0
"But fortunately he was too confused to understand what had happened, because he didn’t speak very much english, and even if he did, he probably wouldn’t have believed it.",0
Somebody was using Katie’s spells to play pranks.,0
And Katie was extremely cross about it.,0
"For a while she suspected Jemma, because she won a poetry competition and was invited onto TV to read her poem.",0
"But then it turned out that she had written her winning verse long before the spell book went missing, and Katie understood that she hadn’t composed it by magic, but by skill.",0
And then Isis suspected Paul because he suddenly grew taller and became quite good looking.,0
"But Katie thought it couldn’t be him, because he was too nice.",0
And then something serious happened.,0
"It was the evening of the school play, and the children, parents and school governors packed into the hall to watch it.",0
Mr Appleton had been rehearsing with the drama society for weeks and weeks.,0
Some of the teachers said it was the best thing the school had ever done.,0
It was called Romeo and Juliet. And when they got to the famous part where Juliet stands on a balcony – in this case a stepladder – and says:,0
"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?",1
Romeo replied:,0
I’m here you silly bat.,1
Have you gone blind or what?,1
That wasn’t anything like the right line.,0
But Juliet carried on:,0
And Romeo said:,0
What’s up Juliet?,1
You weren’t supposed to say that.,1
And Mr Appleton had to jump up on stage.,0
And Juliet fell off her stepladder.,0
And generally the evening was the biggest disaster in the whole history of the school.,0
"Romeo and Juliet were played by Paul and Jemma. And normally they would have been in big, big trouble.",0
Like expelled from school type of trouble.,0
But both of them swore that they didn’t mean to say those words.,0
And Mrs Hepworth believed them because they were both star pupils and always very well behaved.,0
She thought that somebody had put a spell on them.,0
"And she suspected that that person was Katie. Because, you see, Katie was the only witch in school that she knew about.",0
Of course Katie understood right away that she was the prime suspect.,0
She worked up all her courage and went to see Mrs Hepworth in her study.,0
The head teacher said:,0
So. You have come to confess.,1
And she said it with such certainty that for a moment Katie felt guilty even though she hadn’t done anything wrong.,0
she said.,0
"Truly, honestly, I’m totally innocent.",1
Somebody has stolen my spell book and is using it!,1
Mrs Hepworth did not know whether or not to believe her pleas.,0
"Unexpectedly, Mrs Hepworth turned up in place of their usual teacher.",0
Under her arm she held a file on which was written:,0
Questions and Answers.,1
She told the class:,0
We are going to do a test.,1
"And if anyone gets less than seven out of ten, they won’t be seeing the Animal Man tomorrow.",1
Instead they will stay in with me and do mathematical problems.,1
"And the whole class felt gloomy, because this was a nasty surprise.",0
Things got worse.,0
The questions were really hard and quite random.,0
Like:,0
What is the capital of Mongolia?,1
"Let ABC and DEF be two triangles in which angles B and C are equal respectively to angles E and F. If AB is not equal to DE, then which one of them is greater?",1
Who was the seventh president of the United States of America?,1
Katie did not know the answer to a single question.,0
She looked at Isis. She could see her pen hovering above the paper.,0
"Katie,",1
said Mrs Hepworth.,0
Stop copying your friend.,1
And Katie thought:,0
What’s the use copying Isis?,1
She’s as stumped as I am.,1
"At the end of the test, Mrs Hepworth collected all the papers and made everyone read quietly while she did the marking.",0
"When the lesson was over, Isis asked:",0
Please Mrs Hepworth. Did anyone pass the test?,1
And Mrs Hepworth gave a reply that nobody understood.,0
She said:,0
Which is the wicked witch that wished the wicked wish?,1
Soon we shall find out.,1
"When she was gone, Isabelle was saying to her friends:",0
It’s all Katie’s fault.,1
We’re being punished because she put a spell on the school play.,1
And several people said:,0
"Yeah. Katie, you should stop doing spells.",1
"As Katie was about to go home later that day, Mrs Hepworth caught up with her in the corridor and asked her to step into her study.",0
"I’ve got something for you,",1
she said as she closed the door behind her.,0
And Katie saw that on the head teacher’s desk was something very precious.,0
It was her book of spells.,0
"I promise I haven’t looked at any of your spells,",1
said Mrs Hepworth. And then she looked a bit guilty because head teachers aren’t supposed to tell fibs.,0
"Well, just a little peak,",1
she admitted.,0
She handed the book to Katie.,0
"Thank you, Mrs Hepworth,",1
said Katie. But how?,0
The test I set today wasn’t an ordinary one.,1
It was a witch test.,1
A certain somebody answered all the questions.,1
And that certain somebody used magic spells;,1
your magic spells which he or she stole.,1
But isn’t that unfair?,1
asked Katie.,0
What if that person was just brilliant and knew all the answers?,1
The head teacher tapped her nose and her lips formed a smug smile:,0
"You see, they didn’t give the right answers.",1
They gave the wrong answers.,1
But not just any old wrong answers.,1
They wrote down the very same wrong answers that were in my file.,1
And the only way they could have seen what I had in my file was by magic.,1
And Katie understood that Mrs Hepworth had played a very clever trick.,0
Although she wouldn’t say who the,0
certain somebody,1
"was, Katie waited to see who got expelled.",0
"But, in fact, nobody did.",0
"Because Mrs Hepworth thought that if the school governors learnt about her special test, they might accuse her of going on a witch hunt, and witch hunts are supposed to be wrong in this day and age.",0
And so the,0
certain somebody,1
went unpunished.,0
"But Mrs Hepworth knew who that person was, and she was watching them.",0
Download the audio of the tiger story The Brahman struggles to find any one - or any thing - that will agree that the tiger is wrong.,0
Everyone he asks seems to think that ingratitude is the way of the world and he should accept his fate.,0
Then along comes a jackal who appears to be very dim...,0
Perhaps he can save the Brahman from the tiger.,0
"The story was collected in the nineteenth century by Joseph Jacobs who was born in Australia and came to England. One of the interesting things about it is the way that the road a tree speak, on the same level as the animals and the holy man.",0
"Read by Natasha. Duration nine.twenty-one Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap.",0
"He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed.",0
By chance a poor Brahman came by.,0
"Let me out of this cage, oh holy one!",1
cried the tiger.,0
"Nay, my friend,",1
"replied the Brahman mildly,",0
you would probably eat me if I did.,1
Not at all!,1
swore the tiger with many oaths;,0
"on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!",1
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the good Brahman’s heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage.",0
"Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,",0
What a fool you are!,1
"What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!",1
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life;,0
at last the Tiger agreed that if the Brahman could ask three things to judge whether or not the Tiger was treating him unfairly.,0
"If one of them would say that he should keep his life, then the Tiger would not eat him, but would let him go.",0
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly,",0
What have you to complain about?,1
"Don’t I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don’t they return my kindness by tearing down my branches to feed their cattle?",1
Don’t whimper–be a man!,1
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel;",0
"but he got no better result, for it answered,",0
You are a fool to expect gratitude!,1
Look at me!,1
"When I gave milk , the people fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they tie me here, and give me their rubbish for food!",1
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion.",0
"My dear sir,",1
"said the road,",0
how foolish you are to expect anything else!,1
"Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past.",1
"At this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out,",0
"Why, what’s the matter, Mr. Brahman?",1
You look as miserable as a fish out of water!,1
The Brahman told him all that had happened.,0
How very confusing!,1
"said the jackal, when the recital was ended;",0
"would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?",1
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand.",0
"It’s very odd,",1
"said he, sadly,",0
but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other!,1
"I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.",1
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws.",0
You’ve been away a long time!,1
"growled the savage beast,",0
but now let us begin our dinner.,1
Our dinner!,1
"thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright;",0
what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!,1
"Give me five minutes, my lord!",1
"he pleaded,",0
"in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.",1
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.",0
"Oh, my poor brain!",1
"oh, my poor brain!",1
"cried the jackal, wringing its paws.",0
Let me see!,1
how did it all begin?,1
"You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by–",1
Pooh!,1
"interrupted the tiger,",0
what a fool you are!,1
I was in the cage.,1
Of course!,1
"cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright;",0
I was in the cage–no I wasn’t–dear!,1
dear!,1
where are my wits?,1
"Let me see–the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by–no, that’s not it, either!",1
"Well, don’t mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!",1
"Yes, you shall!",1
"returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal’s stupidity;",0
I’ll make you understand!,1
Look here–I am the tiger–,1
"Yes, my lord!",1
And that is the Brahman–,1
"Yes, my lord!",1
And that is the cage–,1
"Yes, my lord!",1
And I was in the cage–do you understand?,1
"Yes–no–Please, my lord–",1
Well?,1
"Please, my lord!–how did you get in?",1
"How!–why in the usual way, of course!",1
"Oh, dear me!–my head is beginning to whirl again!",1
"Please don’t be angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?",1
"At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, ""This way!",0
Now do you understand how it was?,0
Perfectly!,1
"grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door,",0
"and if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they were!",1
And that’s the story of how the Jackal helped the Brahman escape from the Tiger.,0
This is a story from Russia about a boy who learned the language of the birds.,0
"As it turns out, his parents are not so nice, but he is an excellent son.",0
"Some time in Russia, there lived a merchant and his wife.",0
"Their only son was a kind hearted boy called Ivan. This boy loved to listen to the song of a nightingale which the family kept as a pet, or some might say as a prisoner, inside a gilded cage.",0
What is the meaning of her song?,1
"he often wondered,",0
"It is so lovely, yet so sad.",1
"One day, his father heard Ivan asking this question out aloud, and he agreed,",0
Yes I too long to understand her beautiful music.,1
I would give half my wealth to the one who could teach me the language of the birds.,1
"His father’s words made a big impression on Ivan. Not long after this, he was out for a walk in the woods, when the weather became bitter.",0
"The rain was trying to turn into snow, but not quite succeeding, and instead fell to earth in large cold drops, plop, plop plop - most unpleasant.",0
"In the midst of this downpour, his kean ears caught a flustered sound up in the branches above his head.",0
Little voices were crying out,0
tweet tweet tweet!,1
quite pitifully.,0
He looked up and saw a nest where the heads of baby birds were bobbing up and down and crying in the cold rain.,0
Ivan felt most sorry for the tiny creatures.,0
"Instead of hurrying home, he climbed up the tree and spread the flaps of his kaftan over the nest to protect the fledglings from the rain.",0
This Kaftan was a coat that his father had given him:,0
"it was embroidered with gold thread, and not the sort of garment you would would choose to go climbing trees in.",0
He waited there some time until the mother bird returned.,0
"When she saw that the kind boy had saved her young ones from catching chills, she was filled with thanks.",0
"Young man,",1
"she said in good Russian,",0
you have done me a service.,1
It so happens that I have magical powers and I can give you a fine reward.,1
"Say what you want, and it shall be yours.",1
"The boy replied,",0
"Gracious bird, as it happens, there is one skill that I would dearly love to posses.",1
Could you please teach me the language of the birds?,1
"Most certainly,",1
"replied the mother bird, and they arranged that he should visit her every day for a month and learn the words, the grammar, and the tunes of the birds.",0
"Fortunately, the boy had a good ear for music, for birds communicate in song.",0
"He learned his lessons well, did his homework, and by the end of a month could understand everything that the birds told one another.",0
"Soon after this, Ivan sat at home on his usual couch, listening to the nightingale in his gilded cage.",0
"Now he understood the meaning of the beautiful bird’s song, and felt overwhelming sad.",0
"His parents could not fail to notice his unhappy face, and his mother asked,",0
"Dear Van-ooshka (that was the pet name she used for him), why are fat tears rolling down your cheeks?",1
Are you suffering from a love that is not returned?,1
"No mother, I am still too young for love.",1
"I have learned the language of birds, and now I understand the meaning of our pet nightingale's song, and that is why I am so sad.",1
His father was intrigued by this and said:,0
"Well, Ivan, tell us the meaning of our beloved bird’s song.",1
"He sings, dear father,",1
"said Ivan simply, naively, and foolishly,",0
that one day Ivan shall be a prince and and his father shall be his servant.,1
Ivan’s parents had not been expecting such an insolent speech.,0
They wondered greatly about what had become of their polite young son.,0
Perhaps listening to the birds so much had made him quite bird-brained.,0
"Indeed, they no longer trusted him.",0
"Not long after that, the boy’s mother made up some warm milk for Ivan, and mixed it with a strong sleeping potion that would be sure to put him under for a sound night’s sleep.",0
"When he was completely out, and snoring loudly, his parents carried him down to the shore, and by the light of the moon, they put him into a little boat and pushed him out to sea.",0
They thought that he would drown and nobody would be the wiser.,0
But it was not Ivan’s fate to drown at sea.,0
The currents brought the sleeping boy in his tiny boat alongside a ship.,0
"It was a starry night, and the watchman saw Ivan lying in his fragile craft, at the mercy of the next big wave that would surely tip him into the water.",0
"He called to his fellow sailors for help, and one of them used a rope to climb down the side of the ship Into Ivan’s boat, where he smacked the boy around the chops until he awoke.",0
The sailors then hauled both of them up to to the safety of the deck.,0
"In this way, by the kindness of the ship’s crew, Ivan’s life was saved.",0
"The next morning, Ivan sat up on the deck wrapped in a warm blanket.",0
"A flock of cranes flew overhead, and he tilted his head to catch what they were saying.",0
This is what he heard:,0
"Quick, quick, fly as fast as you can.",1
Head for the shore.,1
A terrible storm is on its way!,1
"The boy tried to warn the sailors of what what the birds had said, and urged them to head for the port before the storm ripped the ship to pieces.",0
"But the sailors laughed, thinking that the poor lad must have caught too much sun while he was adrift at sea.",0
"But the storm did come, and it was every bit as fierce as Ivan had warned, and the ship took a mighty battering from the wind and the waves that did it much damage.",0
"A few days after the storm had passed, a flock of swans flew over the ship.",0
Ivan heard what they were saying:,0
Over there is a ship full of pirates who plan to do much mischief.,1
"Ivan reported what he had heard to the captain, who this time took him seriously.",0
He ordered the crew to turn and head for a safe harbour.,0
The swift pirate ship began to chase them.,0
"They raced towards the port, and the boat carrying Ivan and the good sailors reached safety just in time.",0
"Now it so happened, they had arrived at a town ruled over by a king, who was extremely troubled by three crows.",0
These noisy and noxious birds sat on the window sill of the king’s bedroom and cawed day and night.,0
"Servants had tried to shoo them away with brooms, and soldiers had tried to shoot them down with arrows, but all to no avail.",0
Now the king offered a reward - his daughter’s hand in marriage and half his kingdom to the one who could free him of this trouble.,0
But he warned that any time-wasters risked losing their heads.,0
"Ivan heard about this problem from a little bird, and he understood that this was a golden opportunity.",0
He made his way to the castle and offered his service in the matter of the three crows.,0
The king’s chamberlain showed him to the window where the birds sat and squawked.,0
"Ivan listened to what they were saying and told the chamberlain,",0
"There are three crows, a father crow, a mother crow, and a son crow.",1
The mother and father are seeking a divorce.,1
They have come here to ask the king to judge who the son should follow:,1
the mother or the father.,1
"Until they have received judgement in this matter, they will not leave.",1
When they chamberlain relayed this problem to the king he ruled:,0
The son crow must stay with his mother.,1
"As soon as he made this decision, the father flew off on his own with an ill-tempered",0
CAWWWWW!’ and the mother and son left in another direction.,0
The king was delighted that the crows had finally cleared off from his window sill.,0
He gladly gave the hand in marriage of his youngest daughter to the boy who understood the secret language of birds.,0
"As Ivan’s fortune went up, little did he know that his father’s star was falling.",0
"His wife had gone to a better world, and while he was grieving he also lost his fortune when pirates attacked a boat carrying all his merchandise.",0
"The old man became a wandering beggar, dependent on the kindness and generosity of strangers.",0
His travels brought him to the castle where Prince Ivan was living happily with his princess.,0
"There the old man came before the young prince, and begged for alms.",0
"His sight was failing him, and he did not recognise that His Majesty was none other than his own son.",0
"Old man, what may I do for you?",1
asked Prince Ivan.,0
"Be so kind, as to let me stay here and work as one of your servants,",1
"said the old man,",0
"for once I was rich, but now I have lost everything, my dear wife, my honest son, my fortune, and finally my pride.",1
"Dear father,",1
"said Ivan,",0
"you once doubted the song of a nightingale, but now you see that my translation was true.",1
"At first the old man was puzzled, and then stunned, and then frightened.",0
He knelt before his son and begged forgiveness.,0
But wealth and good fortune had not changed Ivan. He was the same good hearted boy that he ever was.,0
"He stepped down from his throne to embrace his father with the words,",0
"Papa, I wish for nothing more than to love, comfort and support you in your old age.",1
And Prince Ivan was true to his word.,0

"Joseph was his father’s favourite son, and when his father gave him a magnificent coat for a present, his brothers became jealous.",0
One day they hatched a plot to sell him into slavery for twenty pieces of silver.,0

Proofread by Claire Deakin & Jana Elizabeth Joseph and His Coat of Many Colours - Many years ago there were twelve brothers.,0
"They lived in a hot and sunny land called Canaan, and they were farmers.",0
"Their father was called Jacob, and his two last sons were born when he was already extremely old.",0
"Their names were Joseph and Benjamin, and the two youngest were by far the favourites of the old man – so much so, that their older brothers became quite envious of them.",0
"Joseph was a dreamy boy, and his brothers were always teasing him for having his ‘head in the clouds’ and not paying attention to what was going on around him.",0
"In fact, Joseph noticed everything, and when his brothers neglected their work or did something wrong, he told their father all about it.",0
The brothers were furious with him for getting them into trouble.,0
"On Joseph’s seventeenth birthday, Jacob gave him a magnificent present.",0
It was a coat woven with a beautiful pattern that contained many different colours.,0
"Joseph loved the coat, but when his older brothers saw it they became even more jealous, and their dislike for him grew even stronger!",0
"One day they were out in the fields, and Joseph started to tell his brothers about the dream he had the previous night.",0
"In the dream, the brothers had been gathering the wheat in the fields and tying them up into bundles called sheaves.",0
"Joseph’s sheaf stood up as if it were alive, and all his brothers’ sheaves bowed down before it.",0
When Joseph had finished telling the dream his brothers were deeply offended and insulted!,0
What is the meaning of this dream?,1
they said.,0
"That you shall rule over us, and we shall bow down before you?",1
How dare you dream such a dream?,1
You should shut up and do as you’re told.,1
"A few nights later, Joseph had another dream.",0
This time he told it to his entire family while they were eating their meal.,0
"He dreamt that he had stood on a mountain top, and the sun, the moon and all the stars had bowed down before him.",0
"This dream was too much, even for his old father.",0
"This is a very unbelievable, crazy dream, young man,",1
he said.,0
"Do you mean that your father, mother, and all your brothers should bow down before you?",1
"You’d better not dream such a dream again, or you may regret it.",1
"When the older brothers saw how angry their father was with Joseph, they were pleased, but soon their dad went back to favouring Joseph above all the others, so they went back to hating Joseph. One day, the brothers went to tend to their flocks in some far away pastures.",0
"Benjamin was still too young to go out and work, but Jacob sent Joseph to join the older brothers.",0
He put on his coat of many colours and went out to look for them.,0
"The brothers spotted him from far off, and while he was still approaching they planned a plot against him.",0
"Oh no, here comes the dreamer boy,",1
said one.,0
"Let’s kill him, and throw him in a pit.",1
We will tell father that a wild beast ate him up.,1
"Reuben, who was the oldest, decided to save Joseph. He said:",0
"No, let’s not be so mean that we kill him.",1
"He’s an annoying little pest, but he is still our brother.",1
Let’s drop him in a pit and leave him as food for the animals.,1
"That way we can truthfully tell father that it was not we who killed him, but the wild beasts.",1
"Secretly, Reuben planned to come back later and rescue Joseph from the pit before any great harm came to him.",0
So when Joseph arrived and said:,0
Here I am.,1
Would you like to hear what I dreamed last night?,1
The brothers said:,0
Did you dream this little brother?,1
"They seized him, stripped him of his coat of many colours and slung him into a hole in the ground.",0
"It was a deep pit with no water in it, and if the wild beasts did not eat him, he would surely die of thirst before too long, for it was a baking hot country, on the edge of the desert.",0
"Pleased with their plan, the brothers sat down to eat their lunch.",0
"While they were eating, some travelling merchants came by.",0
"Their camels were loaded with spices, balms, and myrrh for perfumes, which they were carrying to Egypt. Now the brothers planned a second plot.",0
Judah said:,0
"Come, what’s in it for us if we just leave our brother to die?",1
Let us at least make some profit out of him – it will be the first and last time that he brings any good to us.,1
"We’ll sell him to these merchants, and they can take him as a slave to Egypt.",1
"The others agreed that it was a fine plan, and so they sold Joseph to the merchants for twenty pieces of silver.",0
Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph’s coat in the blood.,0
"They took the coat to their father, and explained that his favourite son, Joseph, had been killed by a wild animal.",0
"Their father Jacob wept and tore his hair out with great sadness, saying that he could never be happy again because of this news.",0
"The brothers were, however, happy that they were rid of him, and had made some money too.",0
"The merchants took Joseph to the land of Egypt, which was ruled by a magnificent king, called a Pharaoh. There they sold him to Potiphar, who was captain of the Pharaoh’s bodyguard.",0
"Joseph served his new master well, and was well liked by him.",0
"Then one day, when Potiphar was gone from the palace, his wife tried to kiss Joseph. Joseph said:",0
No way!,1
...And ran away from her.,0
"When Potiphar came back, his wife lied and made up stories about Joseph attacking her.",0
"When Potiphar heard all this, he ordered Joseph to be arrested and thrown in jail.",0
Joseph lived in the dungeon jail with two other men.,0
"One of the men had been the Pharaoh’s chief servant, called a butler.",0
The other had been his baker.,0
"Both men had done some small things to annoy the Pharaoh, and had been thrown into prison as a result.",0
"One morning, the butler said:",0
I had such a strange dream last night.,1
I only wish that there was somebody here who could tell me its meaning.,1
"Joseph replied that he understood dreams, and begged the butler to tell it to him, which he did.",0
He said:,0
In my dream I was walking through a vineyard.,1
"I came to an especially wonderful vine, which had three branches loaded with bright juicy fruit.",1
"I picked the grapes off these three branches, and made them into wine.",1
"I poured the wine into a cup, took it to the Pharaoh, and he drank it.",1
"Well,",1
said Joseph. I can tell you the meaning of your dream.,0
"The three branches are three days, and in three days’ time, you shall be restored to your former job and you will serve wine into the Pharaoh’s hand.",0
"Indeed,",1
"said Joseph,",0
I can tell you the meaning of your dream.,1
"The three baskets are three days, and in three days time the guard will come and chop off your head.",1
It all happened just as Joseph had said.,0
"The baker was executed, and the butler was restored to his former position.",0
"But for two whole years the butler did not remember Joseph, until one day the Pharaoh said to his advisers:",0
I had the strangest dream last night.,1
"I was standing by the river and seven fat, happy looking cows came out of the water and started to eat the grass by the bank.",1
"Then a little later, seven thin and awful looking cows came out from the water, and they ate up the fat cows.",1
It was so weird.,1
If only some wise man could tell me what it means.,1
But none of the Pharaoh’s helpers could interpret the dream.,0
"The Butler, who was standing near by, heard this.",0
He remembered Joseph in the prison cell.,0
Then he said:,0
"Sir, if you’ll permit me to speak.",1
"Some years ago, in your vast wisdom, your Magnificence saw fit to throw your butler and your baker into the dungeon.",1
"There we met a man who listened to our dreams and understood our fates, and all the dreams came true exactly as he had predicted.",1
"When he heard this, the Pharaoh sent for Joseph. The guards took Joseph from the dungeon, made sure that he was washed, shaved and dressed in fresh clothes, and brought him before the Pharaoh. Joseph listened to the Pharaoh’s dream about the seven fat cows and the seven thin cows, and he told him exactly what it meant.",0
"Your Majesty, the cows in your dream mean years, and the fat cows are years of plenty.",1
"The coming seven years will be full of food, and everyone will have enough to eat and more.",1
"But the thin cows are lean years, and the following seven years will be empty of food and the fields of crops will bring you nothing to eat.",1
There is a great danger that everyone in the land of Egypt will starve.,1
You must find a wise man to work for you during the seven years of plenty.,1
He will put the extra food into storage.,1
"When the seven lean years come, he will take the food out of the storage, and make sure that the people do not starve.",1
"The Pharaoh listened to the words of Joseph, and wondered whom he could appoint to oversee such an important task.",0
"After thinking very long and hard, he decided that he knew of no wiser man than Joseph himself.",0
"And so Joseph became chief minister, and was the most important person in all of Egypt, except for the Pharaoh of course.",0
Everything happened as he had predicted.,0
"There were seven good years followed by seven bad years, but nobody starved in the land because he had saved up enough food during the good times.",0
"However, back in the land of Canaan, Josephs family had not stored up any food, and they did not have enough to eat.",0
"Joseph’s dad, Jacob, sent his ten eldest sons to Egypt to buy some food before they starved to death.",0
"He ordered that Benjamin, the youngest, stay at home, because he could not risk losing another son like Joseph. The brothers came to the Egyptian court, and stood before Joseph. They did not recognise their brother whom they had not seen since he was a young boy of seventeen, and whom they had sold into slavery.",0
"The man they were looking at was a magnificent important official, and they bowed down before him, just as Joseph had predicted they would do, many, many years before.",0
"Joseph knew his brothers, however, and decided to play a trick on them.",0
You are spies!,1
He shouted at them.,0
"They became very afraid, and begged that he do them no harm.",0
"When he saw his brothers trembling with fear, he softened his voice and asked about their family and where they came from.",0
"Simeon, who was the second oldest, replied that they were twelve brothers, but one was dead, and the youngest was at home with his father.",0
"When he heard this, Joseph longed to see his little brother, Benjamin, and he said:",0
"Bring the youngest to me, and then I shall give you what you ask.",1
"He permitted the brothers to take only a little food, and sent nine of them home to fetch Benjamin, but he kept Simeon prisoner to ensure that the others returned.",0
"When they came home, their father wept and said:",0
My children are taken from me.,1
"First I lost Joseph, then Simeon, and now Benjamin shall be lost too.",1
"Soon they had eaten all the food they had brought with them, and still there was famine in the land, and they had no choice but to return to Egypt with Benjamin, just as Joseph had ordered.",0
"This time Joseph received the brothers kindly, and gave them dinner in his own house.",0
Still he did not reveal his true identity.,0
"He was so overjoyed to see his brother Benjamin that he wanted to weep, but he held back his tears.",0
"Instead, he made sure that Benjamin had the most, and the best of all the food on the table.",0
Joseph instructed his steward to fill sacks full of grain for his brothers to take home.,0
"Secretly, he placed the money they had paid for the grain back into the sacks, and into the one belonging to Benjamin, he placed a golden cup from his house.",0
"The brothers left for home, and Joseph let them get a head start.",0
"Then he sent soldiers to gallop after them, arrest them, and bring them back in chains.",0
"You see,",1
"he said, opening the sack belonging to Benjamin,",0
this little thief has stolen my golden cup from my house.,1
"Is this how you repay my kindness, by thievery?",1
"The brothers were shaken and very, very scared, because now they were certain they would be punished by death.",0
"Joseph said they could all go home unpunished, except for Benjamin who must stay behind in prison.",0
"The brothers spoke amongst themselves in their own language, and did not know that Joseph could understand them.",0
"They believed that all the problems that were happening to them now was God’s punishment to them, for selling their younger brother into slavery for twenty pieces of silver.",0
"Joseph heard them, and believed that perhaps they were sorry for what they had done.",0
Then the brother who was called Judah spoke and said:,0
"Your Majesty. Keep us here in Egypt as your slaves, but let Benjamin go back to his father, for he has already lost one favourite son, and if he loses the next dearest to him, it will break his old heart.",1
"If you keep Benjamin here in Egypt, our father will surely die of sorrow.",1
"Let us remain here in your prison, but send Benjamin home to his father.",1
Now Joseph knew for certain that his brothers loved their father and were sorry for their wicked action against his favourite son.,0
He could not hold back his secret anymore.,0
Joseph stood up from his throne and came down to hug his brothers.,0
"All of a sudden, they recognised him.",0
They all cried so loudly that even the Pharaoh heard them.,0
"Eventually Joseph told his brothers to go home to their father and let him know that he was alive, and was the second most important man in all Egypt. They must all return and live close by him.",0
"He would protect them, and make sure that they had enough to eat during the years of famine.",0
What would it be like to be a frog?,0
Have you ever wanted to be one just for a day?,0
You haven’t?,0
Well Princess Beatrice loves animals so much that she once wished for just that...,0
and she soon regretted it.,0
"Bertie and the Frog Princess Hello, this is Natasha, and I’m here with the last story from both the palace and the pond.",0
"As you have no doubt heard, Bertie is a prince again and reunited with princess Beatrice. The wicked queen and Prince Boris are living on the pond as frogs.",0
Let’s catch up with the last news from those enchanted waters.,0
"After the wicked queen was turned into a frog, and went to live in the pond, she set up her court in a little cave among the rocks, just under the fountain.",0
She made it her palace.,0
All it took was a couple of simple spells to create the right atmosphere for a frog queen.,0
The first spell pushed out the family of frogs who were living there at the time.,0
"They were moved by magic to the smelly side of the pond, where all the slime and duck weed collects.",0
The next spell added some turrets and fluted pillars and a drawbridge.,0
"Inside there was a little marble bathroom with gold taps, and a kitchen where Prince Boris the Frog prepared their dinner made out of squashed flies and cockroaches.",0
"On a sunny day, she would often sit out on the terrace, and keep an eye on her new subjects, all the pondlife who lived in surrounding water.",0
"Sometimes she would call everyone together and proclaim laws like,",0
Everyone must make their own beds and tidy up after breakfast.,1
The penalty for failing to do so is life imprisonment inside a snail shell.,1
"You would be hard pushed to find a single frog, tadpole, fish or duck who was happy about the new regime on the pond.",0
"If somebody had asked Colin the carp his opinion, he would have been glad to give it.",0
"In fact, nobody did ask him, but he gave it anyway.",0
They’re all the same;,1
"these princes, queens, and politicians.",1
They’re just in it for what they can get out of it.,1
We’d be better off without them.,1
"Give ‘em all a big kick up the behind, that’s what I say.",1
"At first some friendly fish nodded and guffawed in agreement, but soon nobody was listening to Colin very much.",0
"To tell you the truth, most of the pond’s creatures were too afraid to even think an opinion, let alone speak one out loud.",0
Everyone knew that the wicked queen had some fearful magic.,0
"There was one bird who refused to believe that anyone, even the wicked queen, could be all evil.",0
"Sadie the Swan was certain that that there must be a teeny weeny bit of good in the queen because, after all, she was royal.",0
"Sadie was sure of that because was was an ardent Royalist – in other words she believed that royals know best, and should always be in charge of everything.",0
"One day, she was enjoying a quiet natter with Tim the Tadpole’s mum.",0
"You know what, Henrietta,",1
"she said,",0
I’m going to put in a personal petition to our new queen.,1
Do you really think that is a good idea?,1
"Replied Tim’s mum, who was not at all sure what a personal petition meant, but thought that it sounded rather reckless.",0
"Surely she won’t mind,",1
said Sadie.,0
I think it is rather flattering when people request you to help them.,1
"All I am asking her to do, is to turn me into a human princess.",1
"I have always known that deep down inside, I was meant to be royal.",1
I am sure it would only take the teeniest weeniest bit of magic to make my dream come true.,1
"I would swim carefully if I were you,",1
"warned Tim’s mum,",0
She doesn’t look to me like the sort who does favours.,1
But Sadie was undaunted.,0
"She swam over to the fountain and the queen’s palace, curtsied a little in the water, and said,",0
Your majesty.,1
I have come to you with a humble petition.,1
"May it be your pleasure, your greatness, to turn me into a human princess?",1
"The queen looked across from the balcony straight at the swan’s red beak and said simply,",0
"Because, Your Majesty, I have always felt that I was born to be royal.",1
"My dear, dream on,",1
replied the queen with great contempt.,0
"Prince Boris was just inside the palace, but he had heard this exchange and he hopped out to give the queen his opinion.",0
"I know her,",1
he said.,0
She’s just a silly stuck up swan.,1
"I’ve seen her many a time, swanning around the pond like she’s a princess, but in fact anyone can tell that she’s as common as muck.",1
Sadie was indignant.,0
She pointed her beak at Boris and hissed quite viciously.,0
"The queen raised her voice and said,",0
"Now now, none of that my dear.",1
Prince Boris is quite correct in this matter.,1
You see that worm over there who is sticking his bald ugly head out of the earth.,1
"No doubt he thinks he’s the Emperor Napoleon. In truth, you are no more royal than he is.",1
"While this right royal scandal was disturbing the calm waters of the the pond, up in the rose garden of the palace, Bertie and Beatrice were taking a romantic walk, arm in arm.",0
The prince and princess could hardly believe that they were in each other’s company.,0
"Bertie had been away for so long as a frog, that they could never take their togetherness for granted.",0
Every moment together had a magic of its own.,0
She looked at her prince.,0
"He was in many ways just like his old self, but she could feel that inside he was different.",0
"I mean anyone who had been a frog for eight years would be bound to change a bit, wouldn’t they?",0
"Bertie,",1
she said.,0
Can you describe what it feels like to be a frog?,1
"Well,",1
"said Bertie,",0
Croak. Whoops...,1
"excuse me, those croaks still slip out sometimes.",1
Beatrice giggled.,0
She wasn’t sure if he did that as a joke or not.,0
"All my life I’ve loved animals,",1
"she said,",0
And you really know what it feels like to be one.,1
You can see why I’m so fascinated.,1
Bertie walked on a few steps while he gathered his thoughts.,0
"It was a big comedown of course,",1
he said.,0
I grew up a prince with nannies and servants and toys and the most delicious chocolate cake for tea.,0
Then all of a sudden I was a funny green creature who ate flies.,0
I had to live shoulder to shoulder with all that pondlife.,0
Little tadpoles were swimming around bothering me all the time.,0
"There was this fish, a carp called Colin, who was so rude.",0
"I mean he called me names like, ",0
"pompous,",1
stupid.,1
"Nobody had ever spoken to me like that before, apart from my little brother, and Prince Boris, and the wicked queen – well nobody who wasn’t royal would have dared to be so discourteous.",0
There was a swan who had all these ridiculous airs and graces.,0
I didn’t know what to make of her.,0
"But then, bit by bit, I began to realise that they might be common or garden species, but they had hearts.",0
"Even an amphibian has feelings, you know.",0
"Oh I do know,",1
"said Beatrice, stroking the back of his head.",0
They were sitting down now on a grassy knoll among the apple trees.,0
"I think it changed me for the better,",1
"concluded Bertie,",0
I learned humility.,1
"That’s a good word,",1
said Beatrice approvingly.,0
"Yes, it means realising that you aren’t actually any better than anyone else, just because you were lucky enough to be born in a palace with a silver spoon for your fruity yoghurt.",1
"Oh, Bertie,",1
"said Beatrice,",0
I do think it did you good.,1
"How I wish I could be a frog just for a day, so I could truly share that experience with you.",1
Bertie suddenly became very serious.,0
"He sat up straight and said sternly,",0
"Beatrice, you must be very careful what you wish for, because the wicked queen might hear you – and if you wish for something bad, she has the power to make it happen.",1
"Beatrice kissed him on the cheek and said,",0
"Don’t fuss darling, I’ll be careful.",1
"They would have spent all day walking hand in hand talking sweet nothings, but Bertie had something important to do.",0
The World Cup was on and he wanted to get back to the TV room in time for the kickoff of the big match.,0
Beatrice watched him run across the lawn back to the palace and she carried on wandering.,0
Soon she found herself down by the the pond.,0
"She thought of all the times she had been here, sharing her thoughts out loud with the ducks and fishes, and not realising that her Bertie was just a few feet away, croaking on a lily leaf.",0
She felt guilty that she had not sensed his presence.,0
"Perhaps that was why she exclaimed,",0
"Oh how I wish I could be a frog just for one day, so I could truly know what he went through.",1
The wicked queen was crouching on the terrace of her palace under the fountain.,0
She heard her stepdaughter utter those fateful words.,0
"Quick as a flash, she caught Beatrice’s wish on the end of her tongue as if it were a passing insect.",0
"With Beatrice’s wish inside her frog’s tummy she thought,",0
What a dunderhead!,1
She always was soft in the brain.,1
"Oh well, if that’s her wish, who am I to deny it?",1
"Before the power of the silly wish could fade, she used her magic to make it come true.",0
"Beatrice thought,",0
What’s this?,1
I’ve come all over all funny.,1
"Then she said,",0
Oh dear me.,1
Croak!,1
She tried to run back to the palace but she found that she was hopping.,0
"Then she heard a familiar voice call out,",0
"Not that way, Beatrice. Over here to the pond where you belong now.",1
So lovely of you to wish that you could join us.,1
Beatrice jumped into the water.,0
"She had always been good at swimming, but now she found she could do an elegant scissor step that sent her shooting forward.",0
"This does feel good,",1
she thought.,0
It will be fun just for one day.,1
When she reached the fountain she hopped onto a rock and looked up at the balcony.,0
"Hello stepmother,",1
she said.,0
I trust you are well.,1
"Oh, I’ve never been better,",1
she lied.,0
She sent Prince Boris to help Beatrice find her way up to the palace.,0
"He hopped over the stones and said in his smarmy voice,",0
Good old girl Beatrice. I knew you wouldn’t be able to stand that idiot Bertie for long.,1
Now we can marry and live happily ever after.,1
"Oh no, you don’t understand,",1
said Beatrice.,0
"I’m just here for one day, to see what it’s really like to be semi aquatic.",1
"Boris thought to himself,",0
"Just one day, hey?",1
"I’ll ask the wicked queen to make it forever and a day,",1
"but he said,",0
"Well since you have such a short time among us, I’d better show you around.",1
What would you like to see?,1
"Oh I’d love to meet all the characters on the pond,",1
said Beatrice.,0
Bertie has told me so much about his friends;,1
"the carp, the swan, and the tadpole.",1
In that case I’ll introduce you to Colin the Carp. He’s a charming old gentleman who always has an interesting view on almost any topic.,1
Boris dived into the water and Beatrice followed.,0
"They swam over to the gloomiest part of the pond where Colin liked to hang around, watching for unwary flies, hovering above the water.",0
"If he saw a particularly juicy one, he would leap out and snatch it in his jaws.",0
"Ahoy there, Colin. There’s a special visitor who wants to meet you,",1
"called out Boris. Colin poked his head up and said,",0
Tell whoever it is to make an appointment.,1
I’m busy.,1
"But she’s just with us for a short time,",1
lied Boris.,0
Her name is Princess Beatrice.,1
"Do you mean the so called Lovely Princess Beatrice, that Bertie was always droning on about?",1
Said Colin.,0
I don’t suppose it’s her fault that he bored us all to death with his non stop pining for her.,1
These words were music to Beatrice’s ears.,0
She swam over to Colin and planted a froggy kiss on his old head.,0
"It’s so lovely to meet you Colin,",1
"she said,",0
Bertie’s told me all about you.,1
"Colin actually blushed and said,",0
"Well Princess, the pleasure is all mine.",1
"She had been on the pond no more than quarter of an hour, and she already had won one devoted fan.",0
The cockney sparrows tweeted out the word that the lovely Princess Beatrice was visiting the pond in the form of a gracious frog.,0
Soon everyone wanted to meet her.,0
"Sadie the swan told her that this was the most exciting day of her life, and Tim the Tadpole asked what tasted better, pistachio ice cream or green slime?",0
Everyone who spoke to her felt enchanted by her her charm and grace.,0
"Everyone, that is, except for Prince Boris and the wicked queen.",0
"Don’t worry, Boris,",1
"said the queen,",0
"Her popularity will run a bit thin when she’s done six months of hard pond life, and everyone can see what an airhead she is.",1
"That evening, when the sun was setting, Beatrice joined the queen on the terrace of the palace and said,",0
"Thank you, stepmother, from the bottom of my heart, for granting my wish to be a frog for a day.",1
"It has always been my dream to be able to talk to the animals, and you made it come true.",1
Now will you change me back into a princess please?,1
Because I simply can’t wait to tell Bertie all about it.,1
"But the wicked queen smiled to herself and said,",0
Beatrice my dear.,1
What’s the rush?,1
Why do you want to go back to that nincompoop Bertie?,1
Prince Boris is a far more suitable suitor now that you are a frog.,1
"But stepmother, I only wished to be a frog for a one day.",1
Did you my dear?,1
I must have misheard.,1
I thought you said forever and a day.,1
Never mind.,1
Don’t cry.,1
You’ll find that life can be quite comfortable here on the pond.,1
We’ll have dinner soon.,1
"Prince Boris is preparing squashed flies in a salad of green slime, and he’s roasted a cockroach.",1
You’ll feel better after you’ve eaten,1
Oh no!,1
Cried out Beatrice.,0
You can’t do this.,1
Bertie will be frantic with worry.,1
"It was true, he was worried.",0
His team was losing two-one in the World Cup and there were only ten minutes to go before the final whistle.,0
"When it was over, and he knew that his team were packing their bags and going home, he went to look for Beatrice because she always cheered him up.",0
"But she wasn’t in her room, and she wasn’t anywhere inside the palace.",0
He had a funny feeling that something was wrong.,0
Badly wrong.,0
"He went outside into the garden, and ran through the rose garden and the orchard.",0
"All the time he was calling out,",0
"Beatrice, oh Beatrice. Lovely princess, where are you?",1
"But all he heard back was the sound of a nightingale singing, and the occasional cricket creaking.",0
With a feeling of dread in his heart he went down to the pond.,0
"He stood by the water and called out,",0
"Now listen here, wicked queen.",1
Beatrice had gone missing and I’ve got a strong idea that you’ve got something to do with this.,1
"If you have, give her back this instant or you will be jolly sorry.",1
He got his reply back right away.,0
It was a raucous chorus of croaks coming from the direction of the fountain.,0
The wicked queen and Prince Boris were laughing at him.,0
Bertie waved his fist at them.,0
"Don’t think you can get away with this, you bounders!",1
But what could he do?,0
He had no magic powers.,0
"He ran back to the palace, determined to fetch help, but what sort of help?",0
"By the time he arrived in his room, he knew he had to fight magic with magic, and there was only one person who could help him.",0
Bertie had a distant relative who was a witch.,0
Her name was Aunt Katerina and she belonged to the Russian side of his family.,0
"These days she lived in Edinburgh, in Scotland, because she liked the bitter and biting wind that reminded her of St. Petersburg. It was late.",0
In fact it was midnight – but surely that was the best time to call a witch?,0
"Fortunately he was connected to her on Skype. He pressed her icon and it rang, and rang...",0
"Oh do please answer, Aunty Katerina,",1
he muttered to himself.,0
Eventually she did.,0
"Her face, which was extremely beautiful even though she was getting on in years, filled the screen.",0
"My nephew,",1
"she said, in her still Russian accent,",0
It has been so long.,1
If I had known you were a frog all that time I would have told Beatrice what to do to rescue you.,1
"Yes, she did seem a bit clueless,",1
"said Bertie,",0
"But now she’s been turned into a frog, and I have to admit that I’m as clueless as she was.",1
"To tell you the truth, I’m in a bit of a funk.",1
"Tell me Aunty, you are my only hope, what must I do to get her back?",1
"Ha ha, isn’t it obvious?",1
Laughed his witchy aunty.,0
It is?,1
"Asked Bertie, forlornly.",0
Perfectly. Have you lost your marbles?,1
Don’t you understand?,1
"You must kiss her,",1
said his aunt.,0
"Oh. Of course,",1
said Bertie. He was about to sign off and run down to the pond when another question popped into his head.,0
"By the way,",1
"he said,",0
What chance is there that the wicked queen might turn me back into a frog again?,1
I shouldn’t like that to happen.,1
"Now I’m a prince again, I am starting to relearn all the advantages of being human, and I am rather enjoying it.",1
"Don’t worry too much,",1
"replied his aunt,",0
"after eight years as a frog, I should think you have plenty of immunity against that type of spell.",1
It’s rare to catch it twice.,1
Bertie ran down to the pond.,0
"He stood by the water and called out softly,",0
"Beatrice, darling Beatrice. Come here, I can help you.",0
"But Beatrice was hiding behind a stone on the gloomy side of the pond, and she was softly crying.",0
She felt ashamed to show herself because she felt she had been such a fool to let herself be tricked by the wicked queen and that smarmy Prince Boris who wanted to marry her.,0
"Bertie called again,",0
"Beatrice, I know you are there darling, please let me see you.",1
Colin the Carp heard Bertie’s voice.,0
"He nudged Beatrice and said,",0
"Princess, are you deaf or something?",1
Can’t you hear that Bertie’s calling you?,1
"Leave me alone,",1
cried Beatrice.,0
I don’t want to see him.,1
I can’t.,1
I’ve been such a ninny to get myself into this fix.,1
"He warned me not to wish for anything bad, and I went ahead and did it.",1
"Oh, what a fool I’ve been!",1
"Colin nudged her again and said,",0
Now listen here Beatrice. Bertie spent eight years on this pond and everyday he wished that you would come down to the water and call out his name.,1
Now he’s come to you.,1
So you’d better hop over to him right away or I’ll be cross.,1
You don’t want to see me cross because I’m ugly when I’m angry.,1
"For a moment, Bertie hesitated.",0
A thought passed through his head that the wicked queen might have tricked him and come in Beatrice’s place.,0
The last person he wanted to plant a kiss on was her.,0
What a wrong he would do to the world if he turned her back into a person.,0
Beatrice croaked again.,0
This time Bertie knew it was her.,0
He felt a connection in his heart.,0
He knelt down and she hopped into the palm of his hand.,0
He moved his face towards her green head and placed his lips gently on them.,0
A few moments later he was reunited with his princess.,0
"And that was the story of Bertie and the Frog Princess. We hope the you enjoyed the story and the lovely new picture by Chiara Civati. She’s also doing some new illustrations for our story, Bertie in Siberia, which you can find on Storynory.com.",0
"For now, from me, Natasha",0
"Mr Grabber, the keeper of the monkeys cage, has a new scheme which on the face of it seems to be for a good cause.",0
"When Theo digs deeper, he finds that Mr Grabber and his girlfriend are up to their usual criminal tricks.",0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha.  Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Hello, this is Natasha, and I’m dropping by with a story about Theo the Monkey. You may remember that Theo’s arch enemy is Mr Grabber, the zookeeper who is always up to some criminal schemes.",0
Theo believes in justice and is infuriated that Mr Grabber always seems to get away with his crimes.,0
"In this story, Theo decides that he must take up the fight for what is right.",0
"One evening, after the zoo was closed, Mr Grabber, the keeper of the monkeys, opened the door to the cage.",0
Which of you hairy gang would like some banana ice cream?,1
he called out.,0
"Oooh, ah ah aha!",1
replied the nearest half-a-dozen monkeys who had heard him.,0
"Well swing on out of the cage and work for your keep,",1
said Mr Grabber. Theo was among the monkeys who reported for duty in a line outside the cage.,0
He wondered what criminal scheme Mr Grabber would have up his sleeve this time.,0
"But that evening, the keeper’s aim seemed surprisingly public spirited.",0
"He ordered them to pick up litter and to put it into black bin bags, and whenever they found an old entrance ticket to the zoo, to put it into a special green bag to be recycled.",0
And he promised that he would exchange banana ice cream for full bags of litter.,0
"The monkeys understood perfectly well what to do, and soon they were hopping around the zoo, trailing litter bags behind them, some black, some green.",0
"Sometimes one of them would try to put a crisp packet or a sandwich wrapper inside a green bag, and Mr Grabber would yell.",0
"Oi, you, that monkey!",0
Only tickets go in the green bag.,0
" And while the monkeys were working, Mr Grabber tipped full bins of litter onto the ground and told them to sort out the tickets from the rest of the rubbish.",0
"After an hour and a half of litter picking, the monkeys claimed their reward, and Mr Grabber was as good as his word.",0
He gave each of them a big tub of yellow ice cream.,0
"And there will be more of that tomorrow evening,",1
he promised.,0
"After dark, Theo spoke to Fucious, the most respected old monkey in their tribe.",0
"Oh wise one,",1
he said.,0
What is the meaning of Mr Grabber’s tidying and recycling?,1
Is he a reformed man?,1
The silver haired monkey scratched his head.,0
It is indeed very puzzling.,1
Perhaps even a man as selfish and greedy as Mr Grabber wishes to save the planet from a mountain of rubbish.,1
"The next day, the Peters family joined the queue of visitors outside the zoo.",0
Little Jack Peters said:,0
"I want to see the monkeys and feed them chocolate through the bars so that they all go crazy like this,",1
and he did a little dance while he scratched himself under the arms.,0
"That’s silly,",1
"said both his sisters, quite unamused.",0
"When they reached the pay kiosk, Mr Peters asked to pay for two adults and three children.",0
"That will be £one hundred and twenty-five sir,",1
said the ticket seller.,0
"Oh dear,",1
said Mr Peters.,0
That is rather a lot.,1
I don’t think I have enough money on my payment card.,1
Sorry sir.,1
"The prices went up at New Year,",1
said the ticket seller.,0
"Sorry kids,",1
said Mr Peters.,0
The zoo’s too expensive.,1
We’ll have to go to the playground in the park.,1
At least that’s still free.,1
"As the dejected family started to leave, a lady came up to them and said:",0
Would you like some cheap tickets to the zoo?,0
"I bought some for my family in advance, but now Grandma has been taken ill and we can’t go.",0
I’ll let you have five for fifty quid.,0
 Mr Peters knew a bargain when he saw it and gladly paid.,0
"But he didn’t know that the lady was Mr Grabber’s girlfriend, and she was selling the recycled tickets that the monkeys had picked up.",0
It was Mr Grabber’s latest criminal scheme to make quick and easy money.,0
"The plot would have gone undetected, if Theo had not been watching from the top of the cage.",0
"His sharp eyes spotted what was happening just outside the entrance to the zoo, and he understood everything.",0
That evening Theo tried to stop the other monkeys from helping Mr Grabber to recycle old zoo tickets.,0
Don’t do it.,1
"You are aiding and abetting a criminal scheme,",1
he told them.,0
No we’re not.,1
"Recycling is good,",1
said a monkey called Janice as she hopped out of the cage to join that evening’s ice cream gang.,0
"Once again, Theo climbed up onto the rock of the wise one in the centre of the cage, and he consulted Fucious.",0
"Master, what am I to do?",1
he asked.,0
"Stay calm, be patient, watch, and wait for inspiration to tell you what to do,",1
advised the old monkey.,0
But Theo was not very good at staying calm and being patient.,0
He was bursting with anger and fury:,0
I cannot stay here and watch Mr Grabber get away with it once again!,1
he said to himself.,0
"I cannot stand living with this bunch of monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil even when it is taking place right in front of their noses.",1
I must get out of here.,1
I must escape!,1
He fumed for another twenty-four hours until Mr Grabber once again opened the cage and offered banana ice cream to the first six monkeys to report for litter picking duty.,0
Theo made sure that he was first to swing out of the cage.,0
He could smell freedom.,0
"But before he made his break for it, he quietly slipped his paw into Mr Grabber’s coat pocket and pulled out a key.",0
"Later, when everyone else was busy picking up litter as fast as they could, he climbed up a tree that reached over the wall of the zoo.",0
Theo landed in the car park.,0
"He made for the red motor cycle which he knew belonged to Mr Grabber. He hopped on board, and looked around for the ignition.",0
"When he found it, he fumbled to get the keys into the slot.",0
Mr Grabber was running from the zoo gate.,0
"His girlfriend opened the door of a van where she was waiting, jumped out, and came running towards him from the other direction.",0
She almost managed to grab hold of Theo just as the motor cycle’s engine burst into life.,0
Theo let out the clutch and the bike went shooting forward.,0
He was accelerating like a bullet straight for Mr Grabber who had to dive out of the way.,0
"Quick, get the van,",1
called Mr Grabber. And his girlfriend ran back to where it was parked.,0
"Soon they were out on the street – they saw Theo shoot through some red lights, causing cars to swerve and hoot madly.",0
"He won’t get far like that,",1
said the girlfriend.,0
But what about my bike?,1
He’ll smash it up for sure.,1
said Mr Grabber sadly.,0
It was no use chasing.,0
Theo was soon out of sight.,0
Theo seemed to know how to ride the bike instinctively.,0
"I must have been a motor cyclist in a previous life,",1
"he thought to himself gleefully, as he dodged round an oncoming police car.",0
"He could hear the wailing of sirens, but they soon faded far behind him.",0
"As he chugged up a side road more slowly now, he saw something that filled him with anger.",0
"A woman was walking along holding the hand of a small boy, who skipped beside her, trying to avoid the cracks in the pavement.",0
Two youths ran up behind her.,0
"One pushed her over, and the other grabbed her handbag.",0
The boy screamed,0
Mummy!,1
"The muggers ran down the street, and they moved even faster when they heard a motor bike revving up behind them.",0
Perhaps you can imagine the terror that one youth felt as a hairy paw grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the ground.,0
The motor bike skidded round.,0
The monkey jumped off and grabbed the hand bag.,0
"A tug of war ensued, the monkey pulling one way, the youths another.",0
A police van pulled up and six officers jumped out and slapped handcuffs on the monkey and the youths.,0
"As the police officer helped the woman to her feet, she said:",0
Officer. That monkey helped me.,1
He was rescuing my handbag.,1
"Sorry Madam. I’m afraid he’s a notorious criminal, escaped from the zoo.",1
There’s been a call out on all police radios for him.,1
Fits the description exactly he does.,1
"‘But he’s a good monkey,",0
Stop that Monkey!,1
he was on his motor bike and racing down the street.,0
Hurray!,1
called the small boy.,0
He’s escaped!,1
"By the next day, pictures of Theo’s face were in all the newspapers and on all the television broadcasts.",0
"Overnight he had become by far the most notorious monkey in the country, if not the world.",0
"He hid the motor bike in the park, because he knew that if he continued to ride it, he would run into a police road block sooner or later.",0
"He hopped over the rooftops of the town, wondering what fate lay in store for him.",0
His stomach complained bitterly of hunger.,0
He could see a fruit store holder down at street level.,0
Oooo!,1
"those bananas and apples look so delicious,",1
he thought to himself.,0
I could just hop down and pick up some.,1
"But oh, I don’t have any money.",1
And it’s wrong to steal.,1
"I don’t want to be a criminal like Mr Grabber, even if the police say that’s what I am.",1
"But he was so hungry, that he found himself somehow drawn down to the ground, and towards the store.",0
He stared with a starving look at the bananas.,0
"Hey you’re that monkey,",1
said the store holder.,0
Theo didn’t run away.,0
"He just looked at him, almost ready to give himself up in return for some food from the prison kitchen.",0
You’re the one they call the ,0
"Vigilante Monkey,",1
went on the store holder.,0
You’re doing a great job.,1
The public’s right behind you.,1
"Here, have a banana, take a whole bunch.",1
Take two bunches.,1
"Theo expected a trick, and as he crept forward he was on the look out for the gleam of handcuffs, and he half thought he could hear the sound of sirens.",0
But there was no trick.,0
"The store holder did give him the bananas, as well as a bag of apples, and a bunch of grapes.",0
"It’s a pleasure to meet you sir,",1
he said.,0
"Now be on your way, and mind you don’t get caught.",1
This city needs you.,1
The thrill and excitement of Halloween run through this story of a boy whose mother takes him to a magical pumpkin patch.,0
"When Jack starts to cut eyes and a mouth into his pumpkin, he is in for a big surprise.",0
Written for Storynory by Marlon Heimerl of halloweencostumes.com Read by Natasha. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. The long station wagon climbed up the hill to the pumpkin patch on the ridge.,0
"In his seat, Little Jack bounced up and down, ready to shoot out of the car like a fire cracker at any moment.",0
"Hold on, hold on, we’re nearly there,",1
"said his Mom. Across the the fields, everything shined in the fall sunlight with a soft orange and red glow.",0
This is the tallest hill in town.,1
Jack’s Mom said dreamily.,0
"The tallest hill has the biggest pumpkins – more sunlight, you know.",1
That’s why I first came here when I was a little girl.,1
You will see pumpkins here like you’ve never seen before.,1
I bet there are pumpkins bigger than this car!,1
yelled Jack.,0
I even heard there are magical pumpkins there!,1
But I wasn’t supposed to tell grownups because my friend said they would never believe me.,1
Who said I wouldn’t believe you?,1
"You know, they used to say a witch lived on that hill when I was a little girl.",1
"Now tell me, do you believe that?!",1
NAAAAA,1
", said Jack, unsure whether or not he should be nervous.",0
"Hold on, honey, the road gets a little rocky here.",1
Jack’s Mom held a hand across Jack’s chest as she weaved the car around some big potholes in the road.,0
People don’t come out here much other than for the magical pumpkins.,1
Just sit tight while I focus – we’re almost there!,1
As the car went up and up – around five and then six turns – Little Jack became dizzy and the dizziness mixed with nervousness.,0
"Psshhh, Witches!",1
He finally said out loud with a relief.,0
"Good one, Mom!",1
The car finally rolled to a stop.,0
Little Jack bound out into the knee high grass outside of the door and into the sound of chirping crickets and moaning toads.,0
The wind tickled the tree tops and as they whished and whished against the tip top of the tallest hill.,0
His mother was jogging to catch up.,0
"When she joined Little Jack on the trail, the two set off.",0
"First there was a rocky path made out of cobble stones and then, an orange wooden gate with a rusted copper handle.",0
"This is the entrance to the Old Witches Farm,",1
"his mom said, looking down the trail which disappeared behind a row of trees.",0
"You mean, no farmer planted them?",1
Nope.,1
"You mean, they grow all by themselves?",1
Like magic?!,1
Well with a little help from the sun and rain – yep!,1
"That’s why this place is so special, and why no-body-who-doesn’t-already-know-somebody-who- knows-where-it-is never gets to see the Old Witches Farm. You are a part of a special club now, Little Jack!",1
"As he turned the corner behind the trees, he yelled back to his mother:",0
Where is this pumpkin pa—!,1
"Before he could get the words out, Little Jack stumbled into it.",0
"To his left and to his right, long, dark green and brown vines tumbled across the ground.",0
"Here and there, there were tall pumpkins, short pumpkins, skinny pumpkins and fat pumpkins, warty pumpkins, smooth pumpkins and even some pumpkins bigger than a dog.",0
"Look at that one, and that one!",1
"he pointed, grabbing his mom’s hand.",0
With the warts on that one it would make a great Ogre or a witch!,1
"Or that long tall one, there, that would make a great ghost.",1
"Jack could hardly keep up with his thoughts, he was just so excited!",0
"Or we could do that jar shaped one, there, and make it into a Frankenstein, or even that wide, short one, could be perfect for a creepy smile!",1
Jack turned to see his mom looking down at the city.,0
The sun was already setting over the bridge miles and miles away as she held a hand over her eyes to see as far as she could.,0
"Sorry, that’s great, honey.",1
Pick whichever one you want.,1
she said.,0
"Just know that we only have twenty minutes or so before it gets dark, so let’s get a hop in our step, OK?!",1
"OK, Mom.",1
"he said with more determination than before, looking back down at the pumpkins.",0
And that’s when he heard it.,0
"A low buzzing sound, like the sound of a bumble bee trapped in a jar.",0
"Then again, more clearly this time, like the sound of someone humming.",0
Buzz-buzz-mmmm-mmm-mmm!,0
"I thought I heard a humming, just over here!",1
Little Jack called back to his mom.,0
It sounded like it came from this pumpkin.,1
Buzz-buzz-mmmm-mmm-mmm!,0
Little Jack heard a sound from inside clearly – the pumpkin was buzzing!,0
"It is this pumpkin, this is the one!",1
"Great, perfect!",1
"A fine choice, Jackie-boy!",1
Jack’s mom said.,0
"No I mean, this is the one making noises!",1
"Oh Little Jackie Boy,",1
"his mom said giggling,",0
It is only the crickets you are hearing.,1
"Pumpkins don’t make noise, you know that!",1
"Jack yawned and scratched his head, suddenly feeling rather tired.",0
"It had been a long day and a wonderful trip, so maybe she was right.",0
Maybe he was just tired.,0
"Either way, he was happy with the choice.",0
"As they left the gate, Little Jack noticed a sign he hadn’t before nailed to a tree nearby.",0
It read:,0
No Todds Allowed.,1
"Scratching his head at such a strange and off-putting sign, Little Jack was pulled along by his mother’s hand down the path and back to the car.",0
"Really, Mom, this place is downright weird.",1
Little Jack said as they climbed into the car.,0
"I know, honey.",1
she smiled.,0
Isn’t it just the best?!,1
"Home at last, Little Jack set down some newspaper, grabbed a big stirring bowl, spoon, safety knives and at last, sat in the living room with his mom.",0
Together they traced the top of the head with a permanent marker.,0
Now I’ll cut the top part open since we use the big knife for this.,1
"his mom said, carving into the top.",0
Buzz-buzz-mmmm-mmm-mmm!,0
"Wait, Mom, that humming!",1
Jack’s mom jumped from the sound of his shouting.,0
Jack!,1
You scared me half to death!,1
"What are you talking about, honey, what humming?",1
The...the...,1
"Little Jack struggled for the words, scratching his head.",0
He knew this sounded crazy!,0
"The humming, I heard it from the pumpkin again!",1
Jack’s mom cut again...,0
Buzz-buzz-mmmm-mmm-mmm!,0
"There, again!",1
Jack’s mom gave him a look.,0
That imagination of yours really is something.,1
"But then again, you are your father’s son!",1
She laughed and cleaned the guts off the pumpkin lid into a brown paper bag.,0
"While her back was turned, Jack starting scooping the guts with the ladle – and scooping in a hurry!",0
Nothing!,1
"he said under his breath looking for anything – a bug, maybe – that could be making the buzzing sound.",0
There’s nothing...,1
"In short time, Jack had cleaned out the pumpkin of all of its guts and drawn a grimacing, silly looking smile across its face.",0
"Using his safety knives specially made for carving pumpkins, he cut into the mouth.",0
Did you hear that?!,1
Jack yelled to his mom.,0
It just whistled at me!,1
"Jack-o, boy,",1
his mom said rubbing her eyes.,0
"Sweetie, I’m tired and need to read this.",1
Please just keep carving your pumpkin.,1
"As Jack cut more and more, sure now that only he could hear it, the whistling sound slowly turned into low mumbling until at last, he’d cut every piece of the mouth out and the pumpkin exclaimed, ",0
"Now come on, how’s about giving me a nose and eyes?!",0
You’re talking...,1
Little Jack said with his jaw hung wide open.,0
And you’re a pumpkin.,1
he whispered leaning in.,0
"If his mom didn’t believe the buzzing, what would she think of this?!",0
"Eureka, he can hear!",1
And he’s a problem solver.,1
We have a regular Einstein over here!,1
the pumpkin answered with a smirk.,0
Now I’ve seen everything!,1
Jack said.,0
"Good, now that makes one of us – give me some eyes, kid!",1
"Trying not to lose his mind, Jack finally gave in.",0
"Ok, ok, so you are a talking pumpkin.",1
he whispered so his mom wouldn’t hear.,0
What should I call you?,1
"Well, Little Jack, I thought you would never ask.",1
You can call me Jack-o.,1
"Jack and Jack-o, get it?",1
Sort of rolls off the place where I should have a tongue...,1
"If I wasn’t, you know, a pumpkin.",1
"Ok, Jack-o.",1
You’ve got it.,1
"Little Jack said, carving Jack-o’s left eye into a circle.",0
How about this for an eye?,1
There we go!,1
Jacko-o exclaimed.,0
I like to look someone in the eye when I talk to them!,1
And how aboutttt.....,1
Jack said while stretching to draw the second eye.,0
A triangle for this second eye?,1
Now we are talking.,1
Give my face some character!,1
Good kid.,1
"So, how many is it?",1
Jack-o said.,0
How many is what?,1
"How many days ‘til Halloween, of course.",1
Don’t make me take back that Einstein thing I said earlier now.,1
"Oh, of course,",1
Jack whispered.,0
"Well, let’s see, today is the twenty-nineth so that makes two days.",1
"Then it’s you and I Little Jack, until two moons from now.",1
"Then at last, at long last, I will have every pumpkin’s wish.",1
To be glowing with a candle up on the porch?,1
"Jack said a bit louder, catching a glimpse from his mom.",0
"Nooooo, well, maybe that is your average pumpkin’s dream.",1
"Sure, I could just sit on the porch, glowing like some grimacing goon like all of my cousins and aunts and uncles before me.",1
"But come on now, look at me, I have one circle and one triangle eye...",1
I’ve got a little more character than that!,1
"You don’t want to stay here, then you must want to...",1
come trick-or-treating with me?,1
Bingo!,1
Einstein is back!,1
Jack-o laughed in a gravely tone.,0
"You’ve got it, genius!",1
"I want to see the world, live a little, you know.",1
"You only have one Halloween to live, right!?",1
Better live it right.,1
"Well,",1
"Little Jack looked around,",0
"carrying a pumpkin would be rough, but why not?",1
How about I bring my wagon to carry you and that way we can both still have fun?,1
"Wow, you are on a roll there, Little Jack!",1
"Picture this, you, me, the open road, no porch to hold me back, no candle to make my breath smell like wax.",1
Now I always knew I’d find the perfect companion!,1
Jack-o lowered his voice.,0
There is one thing you’ve got to guarantee me though.,1
What’s that;,1
what’s wrong?,1
You look scared.,1
There is a legend of an evil Sorcerer from your hometown.,1
A pumpkin smasher of epic proportions!,1
"To us, he is bringer of doom, destroyer of everything from seedlings to prized pumpkin.",1
"We call him—Destructor, Masher of Guts. But to you, he is better known as...",1
Todd.,1
Todd!?,1
Little Jack laughed.,0
I know that goofball.,1
He lives down the street.,1
Everyone knows him as a big bully but I’m good at staying out of his way.,1
"He’s like, sixteen or something anyway, so he doesn’t bother with little kids like me.",1
"But wait, you know...",1
Jack stopped speaking in mid-sentence to think.,0
"What, why the pause?!",1
Oh the suspense is killing me!,1
"Jack-o shouted, his face ripe with tension.",0
"Last year someone did smash our pumpkins, and my dad always thought it was him.",1
"Todd. Sorry, Jack-o...",1
Little Jack looked sheepish.,0
W-w-well...,1
Jack-o stumbled on his words.,0
N-n-now that’s why I have you!,1
Protect me this Halloween!,1
"Come on, you are the best friend I’ve ever had.",1
"Little Jack smiled,",0
"Now come on, I’m the only friend you’ve ever had!",1
At least when you could talk!,1
"The two laughed together as Little Jack’s mom turned the page, rolling her eyes at her son’s imagination with a smile.",0
-Part III- Halloween night came before Little Jack and Jack-o knew it.,0
"They’d spent so much time talking that whenever Little Jack didn’t have school, they were laughing and telling stories until they could barely keep their eyes open.",0
Little Jack had even changed his costume over to a creepy scarecrow so he could pull Jack-o around in the wagon with some corn stocks and other things without drawing too much attention.,0
"They were on vigilant lookout for Todd, after all, so the mission was to be as ninja like as possible.",0
"So I can’t believe I didn’t realize this earlier,",1
"said Little Jack as he pulled Jack-o down the street in a red wagon,",0
But I noticed a sign up on the hill the day we met.,1
No Todd’s Allowed!,1
it said.,1
"You know that sounds all a bit crazy to anyone who hasn’t talked to you before, right?",1
"Come on now, Little Jack. If you had a serial pumpkin killer on the loose in your neighborhood, wouldn’t you take the proper precautions?",1
Our White Witch did that for us;,1
she’s a good person.,1
Little Jack shook his head in disbelief as he rang a door bell.,0
Trick-or-treat!,1
"he shouted when they opened the door, lifting Jack-o’s head up to the people in the door.",0
The people at the door gave little Jack a strange look and dropped a handful of candy into Jack-o’s head.,0
Jack-o made chewing sounds with his gummy mouth.,0
"Thanks for sharing your candy with me, buddy!",1
This is delicious.,1
Little Jack couldn’t help wondering if at some point he would have to admit to himself that pumpkins can’t actually eat candy.,0
The pumpkin was a figment of his imagination surely ...,0
"he must have been wondering aloud, because Jack-o turned a darker shade of orange and said:",0
"Well, well, this is just awkward.",1
"Look at that, my own friend telling me I don’t exist.",1
I’m blushing.,1
I guess I should’ve seen this coming.,1
"I’ve told you Jack, the patch is magical.",1
We’ve done our job.,1
Now yours is to believe.,1
"I want to, I really do.",1
"Look, Jack-o, it’s...",1
"before Jack could finish, Todd, the Destructor, the Masher of Guts, came walking around the corner dragging a stick across a white picket fence.",0
Oh no!,1
"T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T, the drumming of the stick on the wooden fence sent chills up the spine of Jack and the gooey place that would’ve been a spine for Jack-O.",0
"Well, well, well, if it isn’t baby scare crow and his little wagon!",1
"Out here all alone, well at least you have some guts.",1
Unlike that dumb pumpkin of yours!,1
Stay back!,1
I’m warning you.,1
Little Jack said with a quiver in his voice.,0
My house is right over there.,1
"Get the White Witch, get her!",1
Jack-o mumbled to Little Jack.,0
Or else what?,1
"What will you do if I, say, grab that pumpkin of yours and crush it on the ground!",1
Todd said with anger in his voice.,0
Yelp!,1
"Get the White Witch, get her!",1
Jack-o shouted at Jack this time.,0
I’ll tell on you...,1
I don’t fight.,1
I don’t...,1
sink to that level like you.,1
"Oh you mean, like this!",1
"Todd grabbed Jack-o from the wagon and raised him above his head, getting ready to throw him on the ground.",0
"Get the White Witch, get her!",1
Please don’t let him do this!,1
Jack-o screamed to Jack.,0
"Jack-o, how do I get the White Witch?!",1
Little Jack finally yelled at the pumpkin.,0
"Jack looked at Todd, who had lowered the pumpkin from above his head, perplexed by the boy talking to the pumpkin.",0
Suddenly Jack realized he finally understood.,0
See that hill up there.,1
he said to Todd.,0
"That big hill, the biggest one?",1
Ever been up there before?,1
"Jack said, trying to stall.",0
"Um, why, yeah I see the hill, but no?!",1
I’ve never been there.,1
Todd had a confused look on his face.,0
"Well the White Witch has been there, that’s where she lives.",1
And she told me to tell you something.,1
"At that moment, a white beam of light cut across the yard and onto Todd, Jack and Jack-o where they stood.",0
"Todd, are you getting into trouble again?",1
A familiar voice said from behind the light.,0
It was Jack’s mom carrying a flashlight.,0
Now you want to put that pumpkin down?,1
"Sure, umm, sure, sorry Mrs White. I’m really sorry.",1
"Jack said, looking at his mom and her flashlight.",0
Wait...,1
he was thinking until his face turned blue.,0
Have you been keeping that pumpkin patch alive on the hill all this time?,1
"Well, I didn’t want to spoil any of the magic for you.",1
"But, sometimes, sure I’ll go up there and toss some seed around.",1
I like it up there.,1
Little Jack nodded his head in agreement.,0
"Before Jack could explain, Todd began to walk away dragging his feet.",0
Bullies never do so well around grownups.,0
"And you, young man, you stay out of trouble or the White Witch will get you.",1
"Jack’s mom said, wagging her finger at Todd. Todd’s lip quivered and he smiled just slightly before turning.",0
That was the first time Jack had ever seen Todd smile.,0
"Hey, kid, Jack. Hey, I’m sorry man.",1
Your mom is a pretty cool lady.,1
"Don’t worry about it, Todd. She is a pretty great lady.",1
"So Mom,",1
"Jack said, pulling the squeaky wagon along the sidewalk next to his dear mother,",0
"Is there a White Witch out there, like really?",1
"Well, I know this might be hard for such a big kid to understand, but try to use your imagination.",1
she winked.,0
"Jack turned to smile back at Jack-o, thinking he would get a kick out of the joke.",0
"Jack-o,",1
"he nodded back,",0
Hey Jack-o.,1
You’re safe!,1
See it all worked out.,1
"Jack-o’s face was motionless, no more Jack-o charm.",0
No more wise cracks.,0
No more funny faces or deep laughs.,0
"He looked like an ordinary, everyday jack-o-lantern.",0
Jack looked at his mom and felt a tear form in the corner of his eye.,0
"Don’t worry, honey.",1
his mom said assuring him.,0
"Like Halloween, Jack-o will always come again next year.",1
I promise.,1
Here it is Gladys has reached California and the final chapter in this series about the girl who wants to make it big as a pop star.,0
We do hope you have enjoyed this series and the music.,0
Listen out for her latest song – it’s really fun – and it’s called Snap Me !,0
The inside of LAX airport was shiny and silvery like her laptop.,0
"The taxi driver who picked her up was Russian born and bred, but actually of Korean heritage.",0
"He had won a Green Card in the lottery that gave him citizenship in the USA. The ride into town took them past randomly placed tower blocks, long straight roads, huge cars, numerous cheap shops and liquor stalls, endless signs in bright colours – orange, yellow, red...",0
There were few pedestrians.,0
"The only people on foot are muggers,",1
said the driver in his laconic Russian accent.,0
"The outskirts of the city seemed random, purely commercial, chaotic, and above all, vast.",0
Where were the pavements glistening with gold?,0
It was getting dark when the taxi turned into some narrow streets with houses built on a human scale and she caught her first glimpse of the ocean.,0
She had chosen her hotel on the internet – but what a find!,0
"She had a studio to herself overlooking Venice Beach. From her window, she could see palm trees and a huge desert of sand and then the deep blue Pacific Ocean. The only thing that spoiled the view were the down and outs sleeping on the dunes.",0
"A lad on a skateboard whizzed past playing an electric guitar, Jimi Hendrix style.",0
He had a battery-powered amplifier.,0
"Although she was tired and jetlagged after the thirteen-hour flight, she was too excited to sleep.",0
She took a walk along the crowded sidewalk.,0
She looked at the other strollers and the diners in the cafes where people ate outside in the warm evening air.,0
Super-skinny women picked at salads.,0
"The men seemed twice the size as Europeans, broad-shouldered, thicker-necked, square-chinned, and muscle-bound.",0
"Many of the hangers-out on Venice Beach sported the torsos of film-stars, but a few were more obese than anyone she had ever seen before, or thought possible.",0
It seemed like a place where everything was on a grand scale.,0
A police car was built like an armoured vehicle.,0
Six robocop officers were interrogating a dilapidated old drunk.,0
A Baywatch dune-buggy scuttled along the beach to rescue a distressed surfer.,0
"Bicycles, skateboards, and packs of joggers sped past her.",0
"The stalls were hip, in the sense of being stuck in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, selling beads, string bags, and tattoos.",0
She shuddered at the thought of a tattoo by the beach.,0
"Some of the buildings were with turn of the century brick and very pretty, others were UGGGH!",0
They were made of bare concrete and so ugly.,0
There was no shortage of down-and-outs.,0
"Rather worryingly, quite a few of the homeless either strummed guitars, or slept with a guitar shaped bag by their sides.",0
Had they too been hopeful musicians drawn by their dreams to California?,0
Had they once naively thought that they could strike it big just by artistic talent alone?,0
"Had they thrown away their chances of education and betterment, and bet everything on their vocal cords?",0
Was she glimpsing her future in this land of opportunity that cared about failure the way the way people feel about disposable nappies?,0
She realised who the true-life ghosts were.,0
Most strollers looked straight through those who never quite made the grade.,0
She saw a man throw a dime to a bum.,0
"His wife asked,",0
Why did you do that?,1
He should get a Job.,1
"The husband replied,",0
He’s just a guy who made a few bad decisions in life.,1
"The next day she saw more of Santa Monica, because that was where she was meeting Laura. She had to admit that the shopping streets were oh so beautiful – perfect pedestrian walkways with gorgeous boutiques on all sides.",0
"It was like London’s Bond Street with the addition of sun and palms, and it wasn’t just one street;",0
every street was like that.,0
Her sister was in her element.,0
"Still the same old Gladdy,",1
"she said, kissing and hugging her.",0
They had not seen one another for two years.,0
"If you’re going to meet my record label, we’d better get you some designer gear.",1
Can’t let the family side down with that gypsy dress sense of yours.,1
"When Gladys took the taxi back to Venice Beach she was laden with shopping bags of clothes and shoes, all bought on Laura’s various credit cards.",0
"She wouldn’t have chosen any of it herself, but hey, if that’s how her rich and successful sister wanted her to look for the important meeting, that was fine by her.",0
"By chance, or design, or a bit of both, Darren Wolf was flying out to LA the week that Gladys was there.",0
"His agent was in touch with Laura’s, and the deal making was taking place behind the scenes.",0
Gladys’s commodity was being dealt in the market place for talent and she hardly knew about any part of it.,0
The business meetings took place around the pool of the hotel where Darren was staying in Beverly Hills. Sleek mums stretched their bony bodies out beneath the autumn sun.,0
The kids of filthy-rich parents splashed in the water.,0
Hollywood execs traded the names of actors and musicians under the striped awnings.,0
The palm trees leaned over the pink-painted walls and eavesdropped on the gossip.,0
"My agent told me not to take the show,",1
"bemoaned an actor,",0
"He said the money wasn’t good enough, but it was better than not working for six months.",1
I shouldn’t have listened to him.,1
"Not far away at another table, Gladys was meeting Darren Wolf and the music specialist from his talent agency.",0
The agent was another of those men who looked like he had been chiselled out of stone.,0
"While Darren greeted her with kisses on the cheek, the agent gave her the most bone-crushing handshakes she had ever felt.",0
There was something about his lips she didn’t like.,0
"They were a bit purple like a Roman emperor who drank wine for breakfast, she thought.",0
"His wide smile with his expensive teeth, his sculptured hair, his powerful aftershave, his baritone voice, all came across as artificial to her European sensibility – but what did it matter?",0
He was so much more upbeat than the down in the dump Brits.,0
"So your contract with your current manager has ten months to run,",1
he said.,0
It’s no big deal.,1
We shall agree to sign an agreement in ten months’ time.,1
The record company is set to expedite this.,1
They are ready to put their publicity machine at your disposal.,1
They’ll give your image an immediate makeover.,1
"Gladys smiled, but she thought quietly,",0
Even Laura’s designer rags aren’t good enough.,1
"Laura and her boyfriend, Simon Ferg, turned up late – perhaps they might be forgiven, as eleven.thirty in the morning was early for them to be out and about.",0
"They got lost in the hotel’s extensive tropical garden, before finding their way to the winding steps that led down to the pool area.",0
"When they breezed in, Laura was all sisterly and kissy-kissy but didn’t quite feel like family to Gladys. The celebrity couple were very nice to everyone, generously scattering their stardust around, but obviously a bit too used to being the centre of attention.",0
"Darren was even more famous than they were, but much more genuine.",0
Is Shamus here yet?,1
"Laura asked, as she leaned back with Simon’s muscly and heavily tattooed arm around her skinny shoulders.",0
Shamus was her A&R director at the music company.,0
"Not yet,",1
"said Darren – but it didn’t matter, because nobody was in too much of a hurry to leave such a nice spot by the pool.",0
At least Shamus apologised with charm when he turned up a little after noon.,0
"He ordered pancakes with berries, tropical fruit, and ice cream.",0
He shook Gladys’s hand and spoke in a soft Irish accent.,0
"So we need to get you signed up and making an album with us,",1
he said.,0
The agent explained that the legal situation with her contract was a little delicate.,0
Shamus swallowed a mouthful of pancake and wiped his mouth with a heavy linen napkin.,0
Don’t fret.,1
Where there’s a will there’s a way.,1
That’s what we pay our lawyers for.,1
It all seemed so casual.,0
"They weren’t really any more interested in her music than the British company had been, but they were all positive that she had a great career ahead of her.",0
Nobody gave her any lectures..,0
"Actually they largely ignored her, and talked about her future among themselves, like she was a stock or a bond.",0
Gladys decided that the wisest thing she could do was to say as little as possible and stay inscrutable.,0
"She sipped on her freshly squeezed pineapple juice and nibbled at her salad like a true LA lady – but then again, perhaps not:",0
she heard a woman at the next table customise her order until it was an entirely different dish from the one on the menu...,0
the poor waiter was practically taking down a recipe.,0
"No onion, extra spinach, and just a little cucumber.",1
"Now pay attention to the next part, because this is the only way I like my salad dressing, it has to be just so...",1
"It’s like the Great Gatsby,",1
"Gladys thought,",0
Only on the other side of America.,1
"The next day Gladys invited Darren, Laura and Simon over to Venice Beach because an all-day rock festival was taking place on the beach.",0
"Gladys soon realised that the person who would have enjoyed it most was her Dad, but he was back in Teddington listening to his vinyl records.",0
"Some of the longhaired and wildly bearded bands must have been going twenty or thirty years and not hit the big time, but you couldn’t help feeling that these old-time rockers loved what they were doing.",0
"They all seemed very chummy with one another, as if they had all been around on the same circuit for decades.",0
"As the day wore on, the acts got younger, and frankly, the music got better.",0
Gladys was starting to wish she could take a turn up on stage behind the microphone.,0
"Naturally, Laura and Simon turned up so late and they caught the best part.",0
"By this time, the audience contained more famous faces than the acts on stage, so it wasn’t really that surprising when a photographer for a music blog sold pics of the onlookers, not the stage performers, to an image agency.",0
"The next day snaps and rumours about Darren and Gladys were circulating once again on celebrity websites, Twitter, and the Daily Post. The record company that Gladys had seen in London dropped her an email asking her to revisit them.",0
"She forwarded it to Darren to ask him what to do, and he sent it to his agent.",0
"Shamus kept his promise to stoke her publicity up, even though the label hadn’t signed her up yet.",0
They arranged an interview with a music journalist.,0
It took place at a super posh restaurant in the centre of Hollywood. Gladys had to endure lunch with a journalist and a publicity agent.,0
She didn’t actually mind the woman who was interviewing her – she seemed articulate and smart – it was the PR man who irked her.,0
The questions were fair enough.,0
What are your musical influences?,1
How was her music different from her sisters?,1
"Even so, she had to be careful.",0
"She wanted to say that she was more serious about her art than her sisters, but that might irk them, and Laura was helping her, and the last thing she needed was a public slanging match with Mandy and Sam. She said that she was taking a less commercial approach, and then realised that the record company probably didn’t want to hear that – after all, commercial meant",0
money,1
and that was what they were most interested in.,0
Her sentence was floundering.,0
The PR butted in and spoke for her.,0
Gladys has staying power because she fits into the classic tradition of singer-songwriters.,1
"Gladys realised that the PR guy hadn’t actually heard her music because she wasn’t quite a traditional singer-songwriter, she was more the serious end of pop .",0
"Even so, she nodded.",0
"Then suddenly, as if to try and get at the real Gladys, the journalist said,",0
Do you promote girl power?,1
"Sure,",1
said Gladys. The PR man clarified.,0
We wouldn’t really want that to go in the article.,1
"Girl power suggests Brit Pop from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys.",1
That is not what Gladys is about.,1
She fits into the contemporary scene.,1
"Okay, let’s put it another way,",1
"said the journalist,",0
Are you a feminist?,1
"said Gladys,",0
"interesting, I suppose...",1
"The PR man butted in quickly, and said,",0
Those sorts of questions are not really appropriate.,1
Gladys is here to talk about her music.,1
"Therefore, the interview never really got anywhere, because Gladys couldn’t overrule the PR Man, as she really needed to sign the contract with the record company.",0
"She could see that the journalist was disappointed with the interview, and really hoped she wouldn’t write anything nasty.",0
If only Darren had been there.,0
"He would have managed the conversation more subtly, and let Gladys be herself and speak her mind.",0
The journalist would have got a great double interview.,0
"Then again, she didn’t want people to think that she and Darren were an item.",0
Oh it was all so complicated!,0
"Gladys flew back to England a different woman from the ghost girl who had come out – yes she did feel more like a woman now, although she was only sixteen and a half years old.",0
She hadn’t had a boyfriend.,0
"She hadn’t had a first single out, let alone an album.",0
"She really should have been at school, but the ten days in the navel of the entertainment industry had taught one big thing – that she must have kind of a detachment from her own career – like she was a ghost girl, but one who was going to float to the top.",0
"She felt she was talented, but she didn’t kid herself that her talent had got her this far – it was luck.",0
The wheel of fortune had spun a few times and eventually the little ball had fallen into her number.,0
Another equally talented girl could have kept on trying and trying for years and never got further than playing at weddings and birthdays.,0
She had met the right person and he had helped her.,0
"Had not Darren taken an interest, even her own sister Laura wouldn’t have lifted a finger for her.",0
"Once others scented her potential to make money and be successful, they all wanted to be part of her.",0
They treated her like she was their property.,0
"The press, the PR people, the agents and managers, the record companies...",0
to them she was just a commodity to package up and sell.,0
"Thinking this all over on the long flight back home, she wrote the words to one of her most catchy songs,",0
Snap Me!,1
"Read by Natasha. Duration seventeen.thirty-six Minutes. English text by Andrew Lang. Proofread by Claire Deakin & Jana Elizabeth. ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen.",0
"She had been married before, and already had two daughters who were exactly like her in all things.",0
"He had likewise, by his first wife, a young daughter, but of unequalled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.",0
"This sweet little girl missed her mother, who had died, terribly much The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have been angry with her;",0
for his new wife ruled him entirely.,0
"When the little girl had done her work, she used to go into the chimney corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which led her to be called Cinderwench;",0
"but the youngest stepdaughter, who was not quite so rude and unkind as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, dressed in rags was a hundred times prettier than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.",0
"It happened that the king’s son gave a ball, and invited all the finest gentlemen and ladies of the city.",0
"Our young misses’ were also invited, for they were always to be seen at fashionable parties.",0
"They were truly delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing such gowns, petticoats, and headdresses as might suit them.",0
"This was a new trouble to Cinderella, for it was she who washed and ironed her sisters’ clothes and got all their things ready.",0
"Meanwhile, the sisters talked all day long of nothing but what they should wear to the ball.",0
"For my part,",1
"said the eldest,",0
I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.,1
"And I,",1
"said the youngest,",0
shall have my usual petticoat;,1
"but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered gown, and my diamond belt, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.",1
"But in truth, they were still not absolutely sure what would be best to wear to the ball, so they sent for the best fashion designer they could find to advise on their evening dresses, and they had their nails manicured at Mademoiselle de la Poche. Cinderella was likewise called up to them for advice, for she had excellent judgement, and advised them always for the best, indeed, and offered her services to make up their hair, which they were very willing she should do.",0
"As she was doing this, they said to her:",0
"Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?",1
Alas!,1
Said she.,0
You only jeer me.,1
It is not for a poor girl like me to go there.,1
"You’re quite right,",1
"replied they,",0
it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.,1
"Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads all wrong, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well.",0
"The stepsisters were almost two days without eating, so much were they thrilled and excited.",0
"They broke above a dozen corsets in trying to be laced up tightly, so that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.",0
At last the happy day came.,0
"They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.",0
"Just then, her fairy godmother, who used to watch over her secretly, saw her all in tears, and appeared at her side and asked her what was the matter.",0
I wish I could – I wish I could...,1
"She was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.",0
This fairy godmother of hers said to her:,0
You wish you could go to the ball;,1
is it not so?,1
"cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.",0
"Well,",1
"said her godmother,",0
"be but a good girl, and I will see that you shall go to the ball.",1
"Then she took her into her secret room, and said to her:",0
"Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.",1
"Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball.",0
"Her godmother scooped out all the inside of the big vegetable, leaving nothing but the rind;",0
"which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.",0
"She then went to look into her mousetrap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor.",0
"As each mouse went out, she gave it a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-coloured dapple-grey.",0
But they still needed a coachman.,0
"I will go and see,",1
"said Cinderella,",0
if there is a rat in the rattrap – we may make a coachman of him.,1
"You’re a smart one,",1
"replied her godmother,",0
go and look.,1
"Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats.",0
"The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and having touched him with her wand, was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.",0
"After that, she said to her:",0
"Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering can, bring them to me.",1
"She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their uniforms all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives.",0
The fairy then said to Cinderella:,0
"Well, you have here transport fit to take you to the ball.",1
Are you not pleased with it?,1
"Oh yes,",1
"cried she,",0
"but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?",1
"Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels.",0
"This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.",0
"Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach;",0
"but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay until after midnight, telling her at the same time that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before.",0
She promised her godmother she would not fail to leave the ball before midnight;,0
"and then away she went, scarce able to contain herself for joy.",0
"The king’s son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was to come, ran out to receive her.",0
"He gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.",0
"There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauty of the unknown newcomer.",0
Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of:,0
How lovely she is!,1
How lovely she is!,1
"The king himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and telling the queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.",0
"All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some made the next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.",0
"The king’s son led her to the most honourable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him.",0
She danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her.,0
"A fine banquet was served up, of which the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.",0
"She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand polite gestures, giving them part of the oranges and lemon blossoms which the prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not recognise her.",0
"While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately made a curtsy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.",0
"When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the king’s son had desired her.",0
"As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.",0
How long you have stayed!,1
"Cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just woken out of her sleep.",0
"She had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.",0
"If you had been at the ball,",1
"said one of her sisters,",0
you would not have been tired.,1
"There came there the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes.",1
"She was a thousand times nice to us, and gave us orange and lemon blossoms.",1
"Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter, indeed, she asked them the name of that princess, but they told her they did not know it, and that the king’s son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was.",0
"At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:",0
She must then be very beautiful indeed.,1
How happy you have been!,1
Could not I see her?,1
"Dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear everyday.",1
"Aye, to be sure!",1
Cried Miss Charlotte.,0
Lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you!,1
I should be a fool.,1
"Cinderella indeed expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal;",0
for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jokingly.,0
"The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before.",0
"The king’s son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her;",0
to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her;,0
"so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven.",0
"She then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer.",0
"The prince followed, but could not overtake her.",0
"She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the prince took up most carefully.",0
"She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped.",0
The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out.,0
"They replied that they had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.",0
"When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella asked them if they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.",0
"They told her yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the king’s son had taken up;",0
"that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.",0
"What they said was very true, for a few days after the king’s son commanded it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry the young woman whose foot would perfectly fit the slipper.",0
"He sent out his most trusted advisers from the palace, who began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the court, but in vain.",0
"It was then brought to the two sisters, who each did all that she possibly could to thrust her foot into the slipper, but neither sister could manage to do so.",0
"Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:",0
Let me see if it will not fit me.,1
"Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to tease her.",0
"The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and finding her very handsome, said it was only right that she should try, and that he had orders to let every girl try.",0

Even the most modern children want to catch a glimpse of him...,0
Read by Natasha Lee-Lewis. Duration twelve minutes.,0
It was a few days before Christmas. Mum was in the kitchen preparing dinner.,0
Harry and Rosie lay on the living room floor watching TV.,0
"I want that for Christmas,",1
said Rosie as a Baby Cry-Cry appeared on the screen.,0
"And that,",1
she added as a Magical Musical Mobile appeared.,0
Then an advert came on for a dancing teddy bear.,0
"Want that too,",1
said Rosie.,0
"You have to write a list for Santa,",1
said Harry.,0
Otherwise he won’t know what you want.,1
"But I can’t write,",1
"said Rosie, who was only three and a half.",0
Suddenly she had an idea.,0
"You write, Harry,",1
she said.,0
Harry groaned.,0
"Although he could write, it took him a really long time.",0
He had only just finished his own letter to Santa.,0
"I can’t,",1
said Harry.,0
"It will take too long, ask mum to do it.",1
said Rosie wailing as she made her way to the kitchen.,0
Harry won’t write my Christmas list.,1
Mum helped Rosie write her Christmas list.,0
When they had finished they put the list up the chimney behind the fire place in the living room.,0
But how will Santa get my letter?,1
asked Rosie.,0
"said Harry, who had turned off the TV and was waiting for something to eat.",0
He sends Rudolf or one of the elves to pick it up.,1
But why doesn’t he come himself?,1
asked Rosie.,0
I want to meet him.,1
"You can’t meet him,",1
said Harry.,0
Why not?,1
asked Rosie.,0
"Because he doesn’t want children to see him,",1
said Harry.,0
"But I want to see Santa,",1
said Rosie wailing.,0
"I really, really want to see him.",1
Rosie really really really wanted to see Santa. She talked about it all the time.,0
In the end Mum promised to take her to a department store to see him.,0
So one morning they set off for the shops nice and early but even though they were early there were still lots of people queuing to see Santa.,0
"I’m afraid the wait will be two hours,",1
said a kind looking lady in a smart store uniform.,0
"Oh no,",1
said Harry.,0
We can’t wait two whole hours.,1
"But I want to see Santa,",1
said Rosie.,0
"It is a long time to wait,",1
said Mum.,0
We could just go to the toy department or the café for a cake instead.,1
said Harry.,0
said Rosie.,0
I want to wait.,1
So they waited and waited and Harry felt tired and hungry and thirsty and bored but Rosie said she would be really sad if they didn’t get to meet Santa. Suddenly Harry had an idea.,0
He whispered in Rosie’s ear so that Mum wouldn’t hear him So the children and their mother had cake and drinks and then they went to look at the toys.,0
But they didn’t buy anything because it was so close to Christmas and they would have so much to open on the day.,0
It was the evening of Christmas eve and Harry and Rosie were laying out a plate of mince pies for Santa. Harry fetched a plate from the cupboard and Rosie carefully placed some mince pies on the plate.,0
Then Harry fetched a carrot from the fridge and put it next to the mince pies.,0
Shall we leave out a glass of milk too?,1
"asked Rosie, who always liked a glass of milk herself before she went to bed.",0
"Yes ok,",1
"said Harry, opening the fridge and getting out the carton.",0
"Harry and Rosie laid out the snacks and then they went upstairs to get everything ready for the trick they were to play on Santa. Rosie fetched the torch from Daddy’s tool box so that she would be able to see in the dark, Harry fetched Rosie’s skipping rope and put it und the bedclothes.",0
"Harry and Rosie each had their own room but, because it was Christmas Mum and Dad said they could sleep in the same room so Dad had put up the camp bed in Rosie’s room for Harry to sleep on.",0
Harry and Rosie went downstairs to say goodnight to their parents.,0
Can we go to bed now?,1
asked Rosie. Mum looked very surprised.,0
"I don’t think I’ve ever heard you ask to go to bed before Rosie,",1
she said.,0
"I suppose you really, really want your Christmas presents, don’t you?",1
"said Dad, looking up from the newspaper he was reading.",0
Dad took the children up to bed.,0
They laid out their stockings at the end of the bed.,0
Shall I read you a story?,1
asked Dad walking over to the bookcase.,0
"Actually, Dad do you mind if we don’t have one tonight?",1
asked Harry.,0
It’s just we are waiting for Father Christmas.,1
"Oh all right,",1
"said Dad,",0
Now be good and go to sleep.,1
I don’t want to hear you both talking all night.,1
When Dad had gone Rosie switched on the torch.,0
She had to be sure not to fall asleep.,0
Otherwise the plan would not work.,0
The door began to creak.,0
"Rosie sat up with a start, she must have been beginning to doze off.",0
"But when she switched on her torch she saw it was just Harry going to the loo, not Santa after all.",0
Rosie lay back down in bed and waited some more.,0
She heard the door begin to open.,0
"Harry,",1
she hissed to her brother.,0
"He was waiting with the lasso he had made from Rosie’s skipping rope, ready to throw it round Santa so that he could not leave without speaking to them.",0
The door opened and...mum walked in.,0
"Hello children, I’ve just come to give you a kiss goodnight,",1
she said.,0
Harry what are you doing with Rosie’s skipping rope?,1
It is time to go to sleep.,1
After mum had gone Harry and Rosie sat up talking a little longer.,0
Would Santa never come?,0
Harry opened his eyes.,0
"It was still dark outside but the stocking at the end of his bed, which was more of a sack than a stocking really, was bulging.",0
"Rosie,",1
said Harry shaking his sister.,0
"Rosie, he’s been.",1
We missed Santa.,1
Rosie sat up and began rubbing her eyes.,0
"Oh but I really wanted to meet him,",1
she said.,0
she said.,0
I don’t want that.,1
Harry looked at the football annual Rosie had disgarded.,0
He would have liked that himself.,0
Oh well.,0
He had his own presents to open.,0
He ripped off the paper of the first one.,0
A baby cry-cry.,0
No way.,0
"I don’t want this,",1
said Harry. Rosie by now had opened her second present – a toy airplane.,0
"Harry’s second present was even worse than the first, a pink dress.",0
"The more presents they opened, the more disappointed the children became.",0
"Oh well, at least I can eat these,",1
"said Harry pulling out a packet of sweets, as he sat among a dancing teddy bear, a packet of hair clips and a book about fairies.",0
Mum and Dad came into the room.,0
"Oh you’re up already,",1
said Mum.,0
How are your presents?,1
"Awful,",1
said Harry.,0
"Horrid,",1
said Rosie.,0
What do you mean?,1
"asked Dad. Dad looked down at Harry’s pile, and then across at Rosie’s.",0
Do you think you may have got the wrong stocking?,1
said Dad. Suddenly everything made sense.,0
"Harry leapt with joy onto the Thunderbirds characters, the remote control boat and the football boots.",0
Rosie kissed baby cry-cry.,0
You know what Rosie?,1
said Harry.,0
"we were trying to trick Santa, but in the end I think it was him who tricked us.",1
"These days, Prince Bertie is a human Prince who lives in the Palace. The Wicked Queen is now a frog who lives on the pond, but that does not stop her making trouble.",0
"She persuades a fairy to give some very contrasting dreams to Beatrice and Bertie, leading to heartbreak and rift in their sweetheart relationship.",0
Have you ever wondered where dreams come from?,0
I know I have.,0
"Bertie says that our dreams are given to us by a fairy called Queen Mab. And he says that if you don’t believe him, you should check out the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare where it’s all explained in one of the speeches.",0
"Queen mab is no bigger than your thumbnail, and she flies in a hazelnut shell that was made into a coach for her by squirrels.",0
It’s pulled through the air by gnats.,0
"She can land on your nose while you are asleep, and put all sorts of silly ideas into your brain, unless she tickles you so much that you sneeze, which is quite dangerous for her as she’s so small.",0
Shakespeare tells us that she makes lovers dream of kisses and lawyers dream of fat fees.,0
"So that’s good, everyone can be happy when they are asleep.",0
"A while ago, Queen Mab was flying over a pond.",0
"There were loads of silly tadpoles, and she made them all dream that they were playing leap frog.",0
There was a posh swan who dreamt that she was a princess.,0
"And there was a grumpy old fish, who dreamt that he was a judge and had sent all the other podlife to prison, and lived happily on his own with nobody to bother him.",0
"And then there was a frog, who had once been a wicked queen.",0
"She was only pretending to be asleep, and when Queen Mab flew by she stuck out her sticky tongue and caught her on the end of it.",0
Snap!,0
"She pulled the poor fairy into her mouth, but did not swallow.",0
Help!,1
Help!,1
called out Queen Mab.,0
"Now, don’t get me wrong,",1
"said the wicked queen frog - well she didn’t actually say it because her mouth was full, what she said was :",0
"Ma, na, ma, na mum.",1
Bother!,1
"she thought,",0
"and then she realised that as Queen Mab could understand dreams, she could probably read thoughts too, so she rolled out her tongue and looked at the hapless Queen Mab who was still stuck on the end of it.",0
Actually she saw her double because she was looking at her cross-eyed.,0
"She thought out loud, ",0
I’m very tempted to swallow you down because I’ll get a warm feeling in my tummy and I might ingest some of your magical powers.,1
Oh please let me go.,1
"I’ll pay you back with bags of sweet dreams for ever more,",1
replied the frightened fairy.,0
"I don’t want to overdose on sweetness, thank you very much,",1
"said the frog queen,",0
"but I do want you to give some special dreams to two humans who live in the Royal Palace. Their names are Prince Bertie and Princess Beatrice, you know them right?",1
"Oh yes,",1
"said Queen Mab,",0
Bertie likes to dream that people laugh at his funny jokes.,1
Dream on Bertie!,1
exclaimed the Queen.,0
His jokes are famously unfunny.,1
And what does Beatrice see in her sleep?,1
"Oh it’s a pleasure to give her dreams, she wants to do kind things, like saving old donkeys from cruel farmers, and giving Royal Pardons to prisoners who promise to be good.",1
"Same old silly, soppy, softie waste of space!",1
commented the Wicked Queen.,0
Now listen well.,1
If you want to go free you must promise to give Bertie and Beatrice the exact dreams that I tell you.,1
So what’s it to be?,1
Deal or dinner?,1
Deal Deal!,1
"called out Queen Mab. I’m only six hundred and twenty-one years old, far too young for a fairy to be your dinner.",0
"Right-oh,",1
"said the Wicked Queen Frog, as she unstuck her captive and set her on the grass.",0
Poor Queen Mab was shivering with fright and was all wet with froggy saliva.,0
"Now listen well, you pathetic fairy, if you want to live for a few more hundred years, you will follow my instructions to the letter.",0
This is what you must put into Bertie’s head.,0
"Let him dream that he has a new Royal Yacht, the biggest, most luxurious, and most expensive boat in the world.",0
"He decides to spend his life on this floating hotel, where all his meals including his eggy soldiers and his fish and chips are prepared by a five star michelin chef.",0
"He has a personal butler, who squirts toothpaste on his brush for him, and all the many servants and sailors bow and scrape and call him ",0
Your Royal Highness.,1
"He spends all day playing on his tablet and sunning himself around the pool, and in the evening a choir sings him to sleep with ‘All Hail Prince Bertie’.",0
Got that?,0
"Yes, got it,",1
"said Queen Mab sadly, who thought it was a very spoilt sort of dream to give a prince and might make him rather horrible.",0
"Now this is the dream you must give Beatrice. In her dream she realises that she hates being a princess and living a life of luxury, and all she really wants is to be ordinary.",1
"She gives away all her lovely clothes, moves out of the palace, changes her name to Maurine, and finds contentment working as a waitress in a tea shop.",1
Got that too?,1
"If you are really sure that’s what you want,",1
said Queen Mab.,0
Don’t you dare doubt it!,1
"screeched the Wicked Queen frog, and Queen Mab felt so scared that she did not doubt it for a second longer.",0
"In fact, she flew straight to the palace where she gave the sleeping Bertie and Beatrice the exact same dreams that the Wicked Frog had described.",0
"Now, as you know, Beatrice and Bertie are sweethearts and are engaged to be married.",0
"They have promised to hold no secrets from each other, including their inner-most feelings and dreams.",0
"In the morning, over the breakfast table, Beatrice said:",0
"Bertie, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we both had the same dreams?",1
"Yes, it would,",1
"said Bertie,",0
"In fact, last night I had a most amazing dream about living the life of luxury on board a brand new, super-duper Royal Yacht. Now I’m willing to bet an entire box of Greedy Bars that you had the exact same dream, my darling.",1
"Well, actually,",1
"said Beatrice blushing,",0
My dream was more profound.,1
"Great,",1
"said Bertie,",0
I’m all ears...,1
What does ‘profound’ mean by the way?,1
"It means it was deep and meaningful, ",1
"said Beatrice,",0
"In fact, in this dream I discovered my true heart’s desire.",1
"That’s where I come in, right?",1
said Bertie.,0
"No, Bertie, it wasn’t that sort of true heart’s desire.",1
"Oh, bother.",1
"In this dream, I realised that I simply hate being a princess, living a life of luxury and privilege, and all I really want is to be ordinary.",1
Ordinary?’ said Bertie. ,0
Boring!!!!!!!,1
"There is honesty in hard work and daily toil and struggle,",1
insisted Beatrice.,0
"Oh, I see,",1
"said Bertie,",0
"Poor Beatrice, you had a nightmare.",1
"Bertie, has it ever occurred to you that it’s simply not fair to have all these lovely clothes, a beautiful room in a palace, servants ready to run and jump at my every whim, invitations to balls and amazing events, and delicious food at every meal, when other people have to work and struggle for a living?",1
I want to be ordinary so that I can live among ordinary people and share their hopes and fears.,1
"Bertie scratched his head,",0
I don’t suppose I would ever have one like that myself.,1
"Well that’s the trouble,",1
"said Beatrice,",0
"when two people have separate dreams, they can’t be together for the rest of their lives.",1
I’m breaking off our engagement and moving out of the palace as soon as I can rent a room in the town.,1
"Beatrice, darling, you can’t really mean that,",1
"pleaded Bertie, but she did meant it and she ran back to her room in the West Tower and locked the door.",0
Bertie was certain that her strange dream would wear off by lunchtime.,0
He got on with his busy schedule.,0
That day he was opening a new wing of the town hospital and visiting a school to talk to the children and give them encouragement.,0
"Normally Beatrice would have come with him, but he made excuses for her, saying that she had a cold.",0
"In the evening, when Bertie got back from his appointments, Beatrice was gone.",0
The palace nurse said she had packed one suitcase and left in a taxi.,0
"He found a note under his door saying, Dearest Bertie Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the fairy tale romance, but now I know that my true dream is to live in the Real World.",0
"Oh dear,",1
"said Bertie,",0
this is more serious than I thought.,1
"He sent a text message saying,",0
"Beatrice my darling dear, everyone missed your loveliness today, especially me.",1
But Beatrice did not read Bertie’s message because she had bought a new sim card for her phone and changed her number as well as her name.,0
She told people that she was called Maureen. And that is where we leave the first part of Bertie and Beatrice’s Dreams. Do you think that Beatrice is right to say it’s unfair for a prince or a princess to have so many lovely things?,0
Is she wise to give it all up and to become ordinary?,0

"Bonzo is an ordinary pet, until one day his family moves to Kuwait. Pa (Dad) says that Bonzo can’t come with them, and he donates Bonzo to the Space Centre. There he meets a cat and a parrot, and from the first the three animals do nothing but quarrel.",0
"Unfortunately, they have to put up with each other’s company because they have been chosen to travel together on a mission to another planet .",0
You will be able to catch the second and final part next week.,0
"Story by Bertie. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. I used to live an ordinary sort of life, chewing slippers, chasing cats and birds, and generally amusing the family I lived with.",0
"They were all kind of cute, especially the little girl whose name was Jenny. Jenny used to cuddle me and take me for walks.",0
But I always suspected that Pa didn’t like me much.,0
He never really forgave me for the time I had an accident in his new car.,0
"I was only a very small puppy at the time, and hadn’t learnt that you have to go outside under a tree, but after that little mishap he always looked at me in a suspicious sort of way.",0
"One evening, after Jenny had gone to bed, I heard him say to Ma:",0
Of course we’ll have to get rid of the dog.,1
"Jenny will be upset, but she’ll soon get over it when she makes lots of new friends in Kuwait.",1
I didn’t know where Kuwait was.,0
It might as well be a different planet as far as I was concerned.,0
But I got the message that the whole family was moving there and Bonzo the dog wasn’t going with them.,0
I tried to explain all this to Jenny in the morning.,0
I looked at her pleadingly with my big brown eyes while she was eating her breakfast.,0
"She sneaked me a bit of toast under the table, which was very kind of her, but it wasn’t what I meant.",0
Just then Pa came into the kitchen and shooed me out into the garden.,0
Nasty man.,0
"Normally, after Pa has dropped Jenny off at school, we don’t see him until evening, and we can all get on with our business without being shooed and ordered about, but this time he came back home straight away.",0
I knew that something was up.,0
Soon he was pulling me by the lead to the back of his car.,0
"I dug my heals in as best I could, but he was much bigger than me.",0
"If you are a dog, you soon learn that it’s best to trot along on the lead, rather than to sit down and be dragged.",0
"You end up at the same place, but with fewer bumps on your behind.",0
"I hopped into the car, but without any enthusiasm.",0
Somehow I didn’t think that we were going walkies in the park.,0
Pa drove out of the town and onto the big road.,0
"I got bored and thirsty and went to sleep on the back seat, but I didn’t have any nice dreams.",0
"Eventually I realized that Pa was parking the car, and I pressed my nose against the window to see where we were.",0
"It was a strange place, rather desperately in need of some grass and a few nice trees.",0
"It was all hot tarmac, gleaming glass, and concrete.",0
Pa led me inside a huge building.,0
"After a long wait, a woman dressed in a white coat came to collect me.",0
"Uh-oh, I thought.",0
This is one of those vets.,0
I know what that means.,0
"Kind, weezily words like:",0
"Nice doggy, this won’t hurt you,",1
that nobody but a fool would believe.,0
"Then all of a sudden, a sharp jab in the behind.",0
The treachery!,0
Pa left me there without so much as a curt pat on the head.,0
"AW!"" If only Jenny knew that I was here.",0
"The woman put me – would you believe it, into A CAGE!",0
The humiliation of it!,0
"Me, a loved family pet, dumped in the animal prison.",0
For I wasn’t the only creature there.,0
"I was sharing this gaol with a cat, a monkey and a parrot, each in its own cage.",0
I couldn’t even be bothered to snarl at the cat.,0
What was the point?,0
We were all suffering together.,0
"""AooooW!",0
"AoooooW!"" After a while, the cat said to me:",0
Stop moaning pooch features.,0
You won’t be here long.,0
"They only need intelligent animals in this place."" ",0
What for?,1
I asked.,0
"Why, haven’t you read the poster on the wall?",1
asked the cat.,0
"Oh, pardon me.",1
I forgot for a moment.,1
You’re a dog so you’re too stupid to read.,1
Well I’ll tell you.,1
"That’s a picture of a rocket, and the writing says that this is a Space Centre. This is where they pick animals to be astronauts and to go to places in the sky.",1
"But as I said, you needn’t worry.",1
Only intelligent animals can pass all the tests.,1
Of course I didn’t believe her.,0
Cats talk the most utter nonsense – you know.,0
The cat hissed:,0
Stupid Pooch!,1
And I snarled through the bars of my cage.,0
She wouldn’t have dared be so rude if I could have got anywhere near her.,0
The parrot started repeating:,0
"Stupid Pooch, Stupid Pooch.",1
"And I barked and the cat screamed, and soon the woman in the white coat was in to see what all the fuss was about.",0
"Now, now you three,",1
She said.,0
 They can probably hear this racket on the other side of the galaxy.,1
"She looked cross, but she did open my cage and let me out.",0
I felt very superior as we left the others behind.,0
But the place she led me to smelt of disinfectant mixed with pee.,0
That was where they gave me the soft talk followed by sharp jab in the behind.,0
I knew it!,0
The traitors!,0
Soon my eyes felt heavy and I wanted to take a nap.,0
"I curled round, tucked my nose under my paw, and I was out.",0
I woke up in a strange room.,0
"It was a bit like Pa’s car, only bigger and without any windows.",0
The cat and the parrot were there too.,0
"The cat was eyeing up the parrot as if she wanted to eat him, but the parrot was safe behind a glass wall.",0
"The cat and I were free to roam around, so at least she had to show me a bit of respect, in case I might nip her.",0
That was good.,0
Things had been arranged so that I was in charge.,0
"Then some lights started to flash, and there was a rumbling noise for a long time.",0
"The cat looked as sick as a parrot and the parrot looked as sick as well, and I Iooked – probably much the same.",0
A voice squarked ,0
"ten, nine, eight....",1
I looked up and saw it was the parrot speaking.,0
"Oh do shut up you stupid bird,",1
said the cat.,0
And it was then that the whole caboodle started to roar and shake.,0
"At first it felt like my tummy was dropping down into my paws, and then, after quite a while, things seemed to go back to normal.",0
"It was quite dark, apart from some strange greenish lights.",0
"I wanted to go to back sleep, but the cowardly meowing of the cat kept me awake.",0
"Listen Mog,"" I said.",0
"If we are all going to die, let’s die quietly.",1
And that’s an order.,1
But she didn’t shut up until much later.,0
"Eventually, I fell asleep, and when I woke up I saw that some breakfast had arrived in two bowls, one for me, and one for that cat.",0
And the cat had eaten both of them.,0
This was too much.,0
I decided to kill the cat and eat her instead.,0
That would be the end of my troubles.,0
"But when I pounced on her with my teeth bared, I found that instead of shooting towards her, I was sort of floating in mid air.",0
"My paws were paddling all over the place, but it made no difference.",0
Even the parrot was impressed by my flying.,0
"The cat leapt out of my way, and she too was flying around like a fat balloon.",0
This was all very strange.,0
"After we had both settled back down on the floor, I decided to show my leadership qualities.",0
I said.,0
Those humans are probably watching us and think this is all hilarious.,1
"Let’s learn to be friends, at least while we are cooped up in here – and when we get out, then we can kill each other.",1
"Even the cat had to agree that I was talking sense, and the parrot seemed too stupid to express an opinion on the matter.",0
"From then on, we lived by some rules, the most important of which was that if anybody ate my dinner, they were dead.",0
I don’t know how long that awful journey went on.,0
"I used to think that Jenny’s grandma, was a long way away, but this took much longer than going to her place by the seaside.",0
"Food seemed to appear when we were asleep, and although we made the usual mess that all living things make, the straw on the floor just seemed to eat it up and it disappeared.",0
It was a clever contraption that we were in.,0
"Eventually, we heard the roaring sound and the contraption started to shake again.",0
The cat was meowing:,0
"We’re all going to die,",1
and I didn’t even bother to tell her to shut her silly snout.,0
Our journey came to its end with an almighty bump and we were all three of us thrown around the place.,0
"This time we didn’t float harmlessly around, and we all ended up with bruises, but nothing too serious.",0
"But we soon forgot about all that when a door opened in the side of the contraption, and we were greeted by the sweetest, most gorgeous smell in the Universe. Fresh, salty, sea air.",0
"So perhaps we had come to Aunty Jane’s after all, by the round-about route.",0
The parrot’s cage flew open and he was out in no time.,0
"The cat went sliding down a shoot, and I came after her.",0
"Soon I was splashing through the surf of the sea, and the cat was looking at me like I was crazy.",0
The parrot was sitting up on a sand dune.,0
I hadn’t been so pleased to be alive since I was a puppy.,0
"All I needed now was a stick to fetch, and my happiness would have been complete.",0
"When I came out of the sea, I shook myself so that the water went flying all over the cat and the parrot – that trick never goes out of fashion, and I woofed with joy.",0
After a while I barked:,0
Cheer up Mog. Aren’t you glad that we’ve arrived?,1
"I’d be happier if I saw a mouse,",1
said the cat.,0
What are we going to eat?,0
"Unless you know how to fish, we’re going to starve to death."" ",0
"Don’t be stupid,",1
I said.,0
Some humans will come along soon and take care of us.,0
"My owner’s grandma lives some where near by."" ",0
"Your owners grandma?"" said that cat quite astonished.",0
She’s only a million miles a way.,1
Haven’t you got it yet?,1
They’ve sent us to another planet.,1
Click Pictures to Enlarge Katie and her best friend Isis are very different from one another.,0
"Apart from the fact that Katie is a witch, and Isis isn’t, there are many more differences.",0
"Isis has a nice big house, nice clothes, and a very pretty face.",0
Katie is not nearly so well-off in those ways.,0
One day Katie and Isis decide to swap their lives.,0
Katie uses her magic powers for the experiment.,0
"Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Pictures by CaiJia Eng. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth.   It was nineam on Monday morning, and the corridor at school was echoing with shrill voices and swarming with every type of kid – neat, scruffy, tall, dumpy, nice-mannered, plain rude, sporty, smart, not so smart, and the odd genius.",0
Each and every one of them was unique.,0
"For instance, who else but Katie knew the magic spell for turning brown bread into chocolate cake?",0
And who else but Isis came to school with a brand new hair band every Monday?,0
Katie found herself walking behind the blonde head of her best friend now.,0
She tapped her on the shoulder:,0
"Nice hair band,",1
she said.,0
"Oh, Thank you,",1
said Isis.,0
And that’s a pretty hair band that you’re wearing too.,1
"Katie was surprised, because Isis didn’t normally compliment her on what she was wearing.",0
Do you really think so?,1
she asked.,0
"Yes, I do,",1
replied Isis.,0
"In fact, let’s swap.",1
"And before class, there was just time to swap hair accessories and check how they looked in Isis’s compact mirror.",0
"The swap brightened up a dull Monday, and it was kind of nice to exchange something because, well, you would only do that sort of thing with your best friend.",0
On Tuesday they swapped shoes.,0
Isis wore Katie’s solid clumpy lace-ups that were strictly school regulation issue.,0
"As she took her first steps in them, she said:",0
Katie I don’t know how you walk in these without turning into Dobbin the Mule.,1
And Katie tottered along in Isis’s pointy slip-ons with hints of heals.,0
Miss Vile told her that if she ever wore them again she would be sent home to change into sensible shoes.,0
"That’s not fair,",1
thought Katie.,0
No teacher ever said that to Isis.,1
On Wednesday they swapped MPthree players.,0
"Katie listened to Isis’s chart topping girl band music and thought it was fun to dance to for one evening, but Isis didn’t listen to Katie’s underground rock music because it was far too weird.",0
On Thursday they swapped books.,0
"Isis did try to read Katie’s book on famous witches in history, but it was really hard going because it was printed in strange Gothic letters.",0
"Katie read two chapters of Isis’s paperback novel about a girl who had a magic pony, but she thought it was all nonsense, because the writer clearly didn’t have any experience or knowledge of magic in real life.",0
On Friday they swapped watches.,0
"Katie wore Isis’s watch that had little teddy bears instead of numbers, and Isis wore Katie’s magic watch that went backwards for some reason that Katie tried to explain, but Isis simply couldn’t for the life of her understand.",0
But the following Monday neither of them could think of what else to swap.,0
"So they didn’t – at least, not until it was going home time.",0
"As they were crossing the school playground toward the gate, Katie said:",0
I know.,1
Let’s go the whole way.,1
Let’s swap identities.,1
"You mean like, passports?",1
No silly.,1
"Like I become you and you become me, just for a day....",1
"oh go on, please Isis, say you will, it will be such fun, and nobody will ever know.",1
But that’s impos....,1
"But of course it wasn’t, because Katie’s a witch and can do all sorts of things that you wouldn’t think were at all possible, although they can work out rather strangely sometimes.",0
A moment later Isis realised that she was looking at herself ...,0
"only it wasn’t herself, because she was herself, but suddenly Katie looked like Isis....",0
"""Oh no!"" she screeched .....",0
And then she burst into fits of giggles.,0
And do you mean to say I look like you?,1
Of course.,1
"Oh Gross!...Oh I didn’t mean it like that, it was just a joke Katie...."" But Katie wasn’t hurt because it was all too exciting.",0
"Outside the school gate, Katie went to meet Isis’s mum in her car, and Isis went to meet Katie’s mum in her car.",0
The inside of Isis’s family car smelt of ,0
newness.,1
"As Katie strapped herself into the unfamiliar soft white leather seat, Isis’s mum kissed her and asked:",0
Had a good day darling?,1
And Katie thought:,0
Life as Isis isn’t going to be half bad.,1
"And as Isis searched for the seat-belt buckle in a rather rustier and smaller car than she was used to, Katie’s mum snapped her fingers and the seat belt fastened itself up.",0
And Isis thought:,0
"It’s quite nice to be Katie, when every problem can be solved in a snap.",1
Isis had never been to Katie’s house before.,0
"As she came in, she was amazed at the amounts of clutter in the corridor.",0
"There were so many coats, cloaks, and hats that it was hard to find a peg for her coat.",0
And it only got worse the further she got into the house.,0
"The living room was so full of boxes, fabrics, glass jars, old-fashioned dolls, unconnected chandeliers, and piled up antique furniture that she couldn’t find the television set, let alone the remote control.",0
But Isis’s house was so spacious and empty that Katie did not know where to start looking for Isis’s room.,0
She went up the broad sweeping staircase and found that there were six doors and two more floors to the top.,0
Then she remembered that she still had Isis’s book in her school bag.,0
"She took it out, and said:",0
"Book, which is Isis’s room?",1
and the book said:,0
Third door on the left.,1
"Over in the other house, as Isis went upstairs, Katie’s mum called out:",0
"Katie, can you switch on the crystal ball and see if you can find Solomon?",1
He hasn’t been back since he went for a walk last night and I’m starting to get worried about him.,1
"Sure Mum,",1
Isis called back.,0
"She knew that Solomon was Katie’s cat, but she had no idea where the crystal ball was, let alone how to switch it on.",0
She explored the three rooms upstairs.,0
One was the bathroom.,0
One had a double bed.,0
"The other was clearly Katie’s room, because her school books and clothes were strewn all over the floor.",0
A crystal ball sat among the pens and piles of paper on Katie’s dressing table.,0
"She examined it, looking in vain for an on-off switch.",0
"In Isis’s bedroom, Katie was trying on her friend’s tortoise shell sunglasses.",0
"They fitted so perfectly over her pretty, slightly turned up nose.",0
She looked into the mirror and thought:,0
It’s not hard to be popular with a face like this.,1
"Meanwhile Isis was looking into Katie’s mirror and couldn’t help sniggering, because even though Katie was her best friend, her face was kind of funny.",0
Katie searched through Isis’s wardrobe for something simple to wear around the house but she couldn’t find anything at all suitable.,0
"Not the black baby-doll dress, not the tennis outfit, not the emerald floor length silk party dress, not the jodhpurs, not the skiing pants, not the silk scarves or pashminas, not...",0
not anything really.,0
Isis was changing into one of Katie’s hooded running shirts.,0
"She wouldn’t be seen dead in one normally, but since she looked like Katie, it sort of suited her.",0
"When Katie came down for dinner wearing a pristine white shirt, she found her place around the dining table that was as long as a swimming pool and Isis’s mum said:",0
I called Miss Vile and she agreed to change your B+ for Geography to A.,1
My goodness.,1
How did you manage to mellow Miss Vile?,1
asked Katie.,0
"Oh, I used my powers of persuasion,",1
said Isis’s mum.,0
And Katie thought different mothers had different powers.,0
"Her own mum would never think of trying to make Miss Vile change her grades, even though she could easily put a magic spell on her.",0
"And when Isis sat down at the kitchen table in Katie’s house, Katie’s mum said:",0
Did you manage to track down Solomon on the crystal ball?,1
And Isis put on Katie’s puzzled expression and said:,0
"No, I can’t see him anywhere.",1
And Katie’s mum looked worried and said that it was really unusual for him not to come home for dinner.,0
She ladled out the witch’s broth into a bowl.,0
Isis looked at the lumpy green liquid and thought:,0
Will she believe me if I say I’m not feeling well?,1
Meanwhile Katie was looking at three wafer thin slices of parma ham and half a skinned avocado on her white plate and thinking:,0
Is that it?,1
A moment or two later her plate was empty.,0
Isis’ mum asked:,0
Anything else dear?,1
Any chance of some ice cream?,1
asked Katie. And Isis’s mum turned as white as vanilla and exclaimed:,0
Ice cream?,1
You’ve never asked for that before.,1
It’s full of sugar.,1
You’ll get spots!,1
"While at Katie’s house, Isis had finished her witch’s broth, and found that it was quite tasty really, and it gave her a nice warm, full feeling inside.",0
Katie’s mum brought her a cornet with a large round ball of mint-chocolate chip ice cream and she thought:,0
Yum Yum.,1
It was a very happy Isis that went upstairs to Katie’s room after dinner.,0
"She thought to herself that Katie’s mum really was a sweety, even if she was a witch.",0
And there was a nice surprise waiting for her on her pillow - Solomon.,0
"Naughty cat,",1
she said.,0
You had us all worried.,1
She picked him up and was about to call out:,0
"Mum, I’ve found him,",1
when Solomon let out a screech and scratched her nose.,0
AHHH...,1
"she called out, and Solomon streaked downstairs.",0
As she examined the damage in the mirror she thought:,0
"Well at least it’s Katie’s nose he scratched, not mine.",1
"Meanwhile, in Isis’s bedroom, Katie was doing her friend’s homework.",0
"It was full of horrid maths problems, and she was far too excited to sit down and concentrate, so she used a quick magic spell.",0
"At home, she wasn’t allowed to use magic for her school-work, but well, she wasn’t at home, and besides, this was Isis’s work, and it had to look ever so neat.",0
"She changed a few answers to make them wrong, otherwise the teacher might suspect something was up.",0
"And Isis sat at Katie’s table, and tried to do some scrawly handwriting that looked like her friend’s.",0
She made sure that there was an ink blot on the page because that’s what Katie’s work normally looked like.,0
"Later on, Isis sat in bed wearing Katie’s psychedelic pyjamas, and opened up Katie’s diary.",0
All the pages were blank.,0
"I bet she uses invisible ink,",1
"she said to herself, and she thought for a long time about what the magic password might be.",0
"Somehow, with the witch’s broth inside her tummy, she thought she might have some magical inspiration.",0
"I know,",1
she said.,0
It’s catnip!,1
"And in an instant, all the pages were covered in Katie’s messy handwriting.",0
"She turned the corners avidly looking for remarks about herself, but most of it seemed to be about somebody called Paul. But Katie was reading Isis’s diary, and she found that she only filled it in about once a week, and then it was usually to say something about her pony.",0
She picked up a pen and wrote:,0
Today I did a big swap with my best friend Katie who is an extremely clever witch.,1
"In the morning, Isis tried to comb her hair, which was of course Katie’s hair and far more tangled and knotty than her own.",0
It was really quite painful.,0
And Katie looked in the mirror at Isis’s face and thought:,0
It’s nice to be a blonde.,1
She slipped on Isis’s pointy shoes and was pleased to think that Miss Vile wouldn’t send her home to change them because Isis could get away with so many stylish things that she couldn’t.,0
"When the two friends saw each other at school, at first they couldn’t help giggling, but then Isis said:",0
"Hey Katie, that shirt’s not tucked in.",1
And look at this;,1
your tie’s not straight.,1
And as for your...,1
"I mean...my hair, couldn’t you find my comb?",1
"Now that you’re me, you’ve got standards to keep up.",1
You can’t go around looking like a scruff when you are wearing my identity.,1
And Katie said:,0
Why did Solomon scratch your...I mean...my face?,1
"If you’ve been nasty to my cat, I’ll kill you!",1
"And they would have quarrelled more, only Miss Vile came into the class room and they had to sit down at each other’s desks and keep quiet.",0
At break-time they both avoided each other.,0
"Katie hung out with Isis’s friends, and Isis didn’t quite know who to hang out with, because Katie didn’t have nearly as many friends as she did.",0
"She went for a walk by herself around the playing field, and on the way back to the class room she met Rachel, a tall girl from the year above, who said:",0
"Hey Katie, have you been out collecting toads?",1
which was the sort of nasty thing that some people said to Katie quite often.,0
"As Isis shook her fist, the girl said sarcastically:",0
"Oooh–ooh, don’t put a magic spell on me.",1
Meanwhile Katie was listening to Samantha and Isabelle chatter on about which soap stars were going out with which footballers according to Hot Gossip magazine.,0
"Sometimes,",1
"thought Katie,",0
It’s just a bit boring being Isis.,1
"And she began to see that having perfect looks, perfect clothes, and a perfect house could become a bit of a pain after a while.",0
"And so at lunchtime, the two friends hugged each other, and Katie whispered the magic reverse-spell to turn them back into themselves.",0
"Oh, that’s a relief,",1
"said Isis, as she looked at her pretty hands and neatly cut fingernails.",0
"Well I’m kind of comfortable in my own skin too,",1
"said Katie. And she thought to herself that although there was a lot to be said for being somebody else for a while, if only to get a new view on life, you could only really be happy as yourself, imperfections and all.",0
But poor Bertie isn’t really feeling himself.,0
lost,1
mood leads him to ponder about his own True Mother – who was the Queen before the wicked one.,0
"He learns that she is remembered for her magic pancake recipe which she used to put into action every Shrove Tuesday. We hope you will find this story funny, and perhaps even a little touching.",0
"Bertie’s Magic Pancakes - Hello, this is Natasha and I am here with the latest story from the palace where Prince Bertie lives.",0
"Well, I do hope you all caught the Royal news around Christmas – because it wasn’t just big, it was massive.",0
"Just in case you were away on Mars, or you decided to meditate for the whole of the festive season, I’d better tell you :",0
Bertie Turned Back into a Prince!,0
Metamorphosis. Which is all about turning into something completely different.,0
Can you imagine what it feels like to be a happy caterpillar one day and a fluttery butterfly the next?,0
Or a silly tadpole who wakes up as a frog?,0
Or a lava who grows up to be a fly?,0
"Metamorphosis sounds like it might be fun, but Bertie can tell you from first hand experience that it isn’t at all.",0
He says that being turned into a frog was the most traumatic thing that ever happened to him.,0
"And the second most scary thing, was metamorphosing back into a prince.",0
"Yes, I thought you might be surprised to hear that.",0
It wasn’t just that his voice was still croaky and he felt like crouching down and then hopping up again.,0
Something pretty strange was going on inside him.,0
Once he was human again he had – and this is another big term:,0
An Identity Crisis. Which is even worse than a crisis like when you forget to do your homework.,0
"It meant that he couldn’t sort of, well, find himself.",0
He wandered through the corridors of the palace thinking:,0
Who am I?,1
"I used to be Young Prince Bertie, everyone loved me, except the wicked queen of course, then I was a frog, and now I’m – well I just don’t feel like I’m me anymore.",1
The Lovely Princess Beatrice was upset because he couldn’t explain how he felt to her.,0
"She wondered if they had grown apart all those years while he was amphibious – which means, by the way, being almost as happy staying under water as you are when you are up on land and breathing air.",0
The palace didn’t feel quite like his proper home anymore.,0
One thing that he really didn’t like was the picture of the Wicked Queen that still hung in the breakfast room.,0
He asked the King to take it down.,0
The king reproved Bertie quite sternly:,0
"She might have become a frog, but she’s still my wife.",1
"I would have thought that you, of all people Bertie, would appreciate that.",1
Bertie saw that his father had been badly affected by the dramatic events over Christmas. It was all a bit strange seeing his wife drink her own magic poison by mistake and turn into frog.,0
"And as for Beatrice, she kept gazing at Bertie with her lovely eyes, trying to see the prince she once knew and loved so dearly.",0
"While he was in this lost state of mind, Bertie found that he thinking a great deal about his own true mother.",0
"She had been the King’s first wife, and had died when he was quite young.",0
Bertie had spent a lot of time with the Royal Nanny and didn’t see as much of his mummy as most people do.,0
"But he remembered that she was very kind and that when she went shopping, she always rode in a gold carriage pulled by six white horses.",0
"She used to wave a gloved hand out of the window, and sometimes some nice pedestrians would wave back at her, which always made her happy.",0
"As he was thinking about her so much, he went up into the attic of the palace and found his mother’s portrait.",0
"He lifted off the white sheet that was covering it, and there she was :",0
"a few years younger than when he had known her, and very beautiful.",0
She had the same nose and eyes as Bertie. He suddenly felt full of tender love for her.,0
"Mother,",1
"he said to himself,",0
You were good and dutiful.,1
You weren’t the sort of queen who dabbled in dangerous magic.,1
You were old fashioned and principled.,1
"Bertie opened it eagerly, expecting to find a birthday present from years ago – perhaps a plastic robot that transformed into a car.",0
But instead he found an old VHS tape – a video from the days before films that you can download – from even before the era of DVDs. It was probably a movie.,0
Maybe it was the one about the pirates that he recalled liking.,0
He put it back in the box.,0
He took his findings downstairs.,0
"He dusted off the picture, and hung it in his room so that his mother’s face was the first thing he saw in the morning.",0
She helped him to remember who he really was.,0
He thought to himself :,0
"If mother was alive, how would she want me to use my power now that I am a grown up Prince?",0
"And then, he thought,",0
"I know, she would want me to pass a law against Magic. That’s what’s been so rotten in this kingdom.",1
The Wicked Queen set the worst possible example by making evil magic spells.,1
Suddenly he was full of purpose.,0
He sprung up and strode over to see the King in his office.,0
He found him sitting at his desk cruising the internet.,0
"Father,",1
he said:,0
"A lot of unsavoury things have happened around this Kingdom. People have been turned into frogs, swords have been dipped in magic potion, a wicked witch has been stirring up no end of trouble in her cauldron.",1
Enough is a enough.,1
We must pass a law against magic.,1
"The king’s mood was still apathetic – which means he couldn’t be bothered about anything much – and he said,",0
"Yes, yes, do whatever you think is for the best Bertie.",1
"Great, thanks Papa.",1
"In fact, Bertie thought that banning magic was simply the best idea he had ever had.",0
"He rang the bell for the Prime Minister, who came running round to the King’s office right away.",0
Bertie told him:,0
"I command you, by the power invested in me by the King, who doesn’t really care what I do these days, to make a law banning magic.",1
The Prime Minister hated the Wicked Queen and all her witchery and he considered that Bertie’s idea was spot on.,0
He ordered Parliament to meet up the following day and vote for the law.,0
"And to make sure that nobody was sneakily doing any spells on the side, he bought one hundred black coloured vans that were equipped with special radar for detecting magic.",0
Now you may be wondering if Bertie had forgotten his old friends down on the pond.,0
"Of course how could he forget a carp as grumpy as Colin, or a swan as regal as Sadie, or a tadpole as silly as Tim?",0
But somehow he didn’t want to see them for the time-being.,0
He needed to feel happy in his human self first.,0
"Nor did the pond-life forget Bertie. In fact, Colin the Carp was swimming around, curling his lips, goggling his eyes, and telling anyone who would listen:",0
"I never thought I would say these words, but can we bring back Bertie please?",1
"You see, now that that Prince Boris and the Wicked Queen had accidentally turned themselves into frogs, they had no choice but to live on the pond.",0
It was either that or the bathroom – and who would want to live in a bath when the weather is nice outside?,0
"Boris was sulking, but the Wicked Queen was doing her best to straighten things out around the pond.",0
"The first thing she did was to cast a spell to clean up all the green slime, and that really annoyed the pond-life who liked eating it.",0
Then she put Sadie’s beak out of joint by telling her to curtsy when she swam near her.,0
"And she told the tadpoles they must spend less time chasing their tails, and more time doing their homework.",0
"Meanwhile, she herself had to learn to catch flies with her tongue, and when Colin laughed at failed attempts, she threatened to turn him into a person, which was the last thing he wanted.",0
"Everyone was afraid of her, because they weren’t quite sure how much of her magic power she could still use as a frog.",0
"In short, Bertie and his stories, and even his bad jokes, were well missed.",0
"Of course, ",1
"added Colin,",0
"Now he’s swanning around as Prince, eating chocolate cake, staying in luxury palaces, and gazing into the eyes of his lovely princess Beatrice, why should he give a thought to us?",1
"We’re beneath him, that’s the problem.",1
"In a word, we’re pond-life.",1
"In fact, Bertie had forgotten that his favourite food was chocolate cake.",0
Now he actually enjoyed eating spinach because it reminded him of slime.,0
"He liked raisins too, because they looked like flies, only they tasted sweeter.",0
"Oh Bertie,",1
"said Princess Beatrice as they ate lunch together,",0
how you’ve changed!,1
"For the better I hope,",1
"said Bertie picking spinach from between his teeth, while Beatrice cast her eyes down at the table.",0
"It used to be a tradition,",1
explained the cook.,0
Your mother used to come into the kitchen and cook pancakes for everyone in the palace.,1
"We in the kitchen thought it would be lovely if you could take it up again, sir.",1
"Bertie glanced at Beatrice, hoping that she would offer to help, but she just smiled, because she wanted to see Bertie trying to toss a pancake in the frying pan.",0
Did she?,1
"asked Bertie, who only remembered her as being sweet but quite serious.",0
"Oh yes sir, she was a hoot.",1
We all say you take after her sir.,1
Bertie was genuinely surprised by this information.,0
"Beatrice, who was not quite so surprised, asked a more pertinent question.",0
"That’s fascinating,",1
she said.,0
And how did she make the pancakes fly around the palace?,1
"I believe she used magic, your highness,",1
said the cook.,0
"Beatrice raised an eyebrow, because she knew that Bertie hated magic.",0
"In her mind she counted to the three and right on cue, Bertie exploded.",0
Don’t talk such nonsense.,1
You’re making it all up.,1
Don’t I know my own mother’s character?,1
"She hated magic, and she never did anything silly in her whole life.",1
She was a sensible queen.,1
And I think this whole pancake malarky is something you made up to mock me.,1
"In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re in the pay of the Wicked Queen.",1
And he strutted out of the kitchen.,0
"The poor cook was trembling, but Beatrice said soothingly,",0
"Don’t worry, his bark is worse than his bite.",1
He’s just a bit uptight at the moment.,1
I expect he will apologise later and bring you flowers.,1
"If he doesn’t, I’ll give him what for.",1
The princess gave Bertie half and hour to calm down before going to find him in his room.,0
"She discovered him strumming his guitar, which he always found soothing.",0
Beatrice stroked his hair and told him that he had been a bit silly and had really shocked the cook.,0
"I know,",1
"said Bertie,",0
I’d better pick some flowers for her.,1
But do you really think that what she said about my mother was true?,1
"I don’t think she would lie,",1
"said Beatrice,",0
And I expect your mum was always sensible around you to set a good example.,1
She got up to look at the portrait of the Queen.,0
She certainly looks like you.,1
Then she noticed the box with the message for his eighth birthday on it.,0
What’s this?,1
she asked.,0
"Just some old video,",1
said Bertie.,0
I can’t play it.,1
"Well I can,",1
"replied Beatrice,",0
I’ve got a VCR player to re-watch my favourite TV programmes from years ago.,1
Let’s go to my room and see what’s on it.,1
And so they did.,0
Beatrice slotted the tape into the clunky old video player and pressed play.,0
"They wanted to see if Bertie had watched the same programmes as she had when he was eight, but it wasn’t all all what they expected – because the television screen filled up with the image of Bertie’s mother.",0
Surprise surprise!,1
said the queen in a sparkly fun-loving voice.,0
And a very happy Birthday to my darling Bertie. Now you are eight I wanted to show you something a bit special.,1
I thought you might like to learn a few magic spells that are fun and easy to do.,1
"I’m completely sure I have never seen this video,",1
said Bertie quite puzzled.,0
And then he remembered.,0
His mother had died before his eighth birthday.,0
That was why he had never received the present that she had made specially for him.,0
"He wiped a tear away from his eye, and Beatrice said:",0
There there.,1
And Bertie said:,0
Well we had better go and see then.,1
The inspector had a hand-held magic detector that looked a bit like a radar gun that they use for speed traps on the roads.,0
"He pointed it at the pond, and as they walked down the garden path, it started to bleep frantically.",0
"It appears to be something in the water,",1
he said when they were standing right on the edge of the pond.,0
"Well I suggest that you arrest that frog,",1
said Bertie. He had spotted a rather evil looking amphibian sitting on a lily leaf.,0
"It’s hard to say if that’s the culprit,",1
said the inspector.,0
We should probably take all the pond-life in for questioning.,1
"Just my little joke, sir,",1
said the officer.,0
We don’t actually arrest animals.,1
"Oh right,",1
"said Bertie,",0
of course not.,1
I expect the detector is playing up.,1
It’s all very new – this technology.,1
"But if you see anything suspicious, do let us know.",1
"I promise I will Officer,",1
"said Bertie, who thought that the policeman probably did not believe in magic, but was only doing his job.",0
"And so Bertie went back to the palace, relieved not to have been caught breaking his own law.",0
"Beatrice was waiting for him on the steps and she gave him an extra special hug because for the first time since he had become a prince again, she had seen him acting like his old self, and he had made everyone happy.",0
"I would so love to have met your mother,",1
said said.,0
Because she was obviously very much like you.,1
And Bertie felt at last that he had found himself.,0
And that was the story of Bertie and the Magic Pancakes. There will of course be more Bertie stories on Storynory.com.,0
"Now he’s a prince again, there are all sorts of possibilities, and of course we need to see what developments there will be on the pond where the Wicked Queen lives.",0
A fortune telling craze is spreading through school.,0
"Katie warns her friends that predicting the future can be dangerous, and is proved right in this story that is just a little more SPOOKY than usual.",0
Do you have any Halloween stories or experiences you could share with us from school or home?,0
Maybe you have a spooky costume for Halloween. Share your comments with me and  I’ll respond back to you!,0
Story by Bertie. Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. It was the long-hour of the school lunch break.,0
"In a corner of class fourA, a group of children huddled around a desk.",0
"In the midst of them, Samantha was nimbly shuffling a deck of cards.",0
"Not just any old cards, like ones with clubs and hearts, but an especially beautiful and mystical kind known as Tarot cards.",0
"Samantha fanned out the pack and invited Isis to pick a card, any card.",0
Isis thought carefully and pulled out one to the side that looked like it was almost hiding from her.,0
She turned it face up on the desk.,0
Its picture showed a maiden dancing on top of a globe with a wand in each hand.,0
"Ooh, you lucky beggar!",1
exclaimed Samantha.,0
You picked ,0
The World.,1
That card means you’re going to be so horribly rich and successful.,0
"Oh well, we’ll just have to see about that...",1
"but if it does come true, I promise I won’t forget my friends, not ever, not even when I’m really, really rich and famous!",1
"You see, Tarot cards carry images like The World, the Fool, The Magician or The Hanging Man, and some people believe that they hold secret meanings that can predict your future.",0
Fortune telling was the latest craze to sweep through Katie’s school.,0
"Before that it had been kiss chase, and before that swapping Pokemon cards.",0
There had even been a craze for collecting smiley frog pens.,0
"It was only a matter of time before Mrs Hepworth, the head teacher, would ban fortune telling, just as she had banned all the previous crazes.",0
"But for now, just about everyone kept a pack of Tarot cards, or mystic crystals, or even just a pair of lucky dice in his or her desk, or pocket, or school bag.",0
Everyone – that is – except for Katie. Katie didn’t believe in fortune telling.,0
"Her mother had always warned her against it, and to underline the perils of glimpsing the future, she used to tell Katie the following story:",0
"Long, long ago, a King called Croesus ruled the land of Sardis. He enjoyed great wealth, but instead of being satisfied with his comforts, he longed to conquer lands and found an empire.",0
"In those ancient times, there were mystic fortune tellers called Oracles. Croesus consulted the Oracle of Delphi about his future.",0
"She told him that if he declared war on Persia, a great kingdom would fall.",0
Croesus was encouraged by this prediction.,0
"He returned home and led his armies against Persia. A great kingdom did indeed fall, but it wasn’t the Persians, as he had understood the oracle to mean, but his own.",0
"You see Katie,",1
"said her mother,",0
"sometimes you can correctly predict part of the future, but you can never see the whole picture, and that can be very misleading and dangerous.",1
She was a bit disappointed when she learned that Max had discovered the same prediction in another cookie when he had visited the restaurant the week before.,0
Then somebody else brought a cardboard wheel of fortune that had come as a free toy with a comic.,0
"If you spun it, you could get predictions like",0
You will make a new friend,1
"If you work hard, you will pass your exams.",1
"They weren’t exactly thrilling fortunes, but they helped idle away some dull moments in the lunch break.",0
"But when Samantha brought her mystic cousin’s Tarot cards to school, that was it:",0
the fortune-telling craze spread like chicken pox.,0
On the day that Isis picked,0
The World,1
"card, everybody was talking about it.",0
Katie said:,0
Don’t be silly.,1
"Only a mystic person can tell fortunes, otherwise the cards don’t mean a thing.",1
They’re just pretty pictures.,1
"Katie’s jealous,",1
whispered Isabelle .,0
"She thinks she’s the only one who knows anything about magic,",1
"said Samantha,",0
"But my cousin Maureen is mystic, so I think I can be too.",1
It runs in my family.,1
"Well you’re not,",1
declared Katie.,0
"And if you carry on like this, no good will come of it.",1
You’ll see soon enough.,1
I’ll give you that prediction for free!,1
"And although Katie suspected that Isabelle was pulling a face behind her back, she didn’t really care, because if being unpopular was the price of telling the truth, then it was a price worth paying.",0
"As it turned out, Katie’s prediction was one that did come true.",0
"The very next day, Samantha fanned out the Tarot pack as usual, and Jennie picked the wrong card.",0
When I say the,0
wrong card,1
I mean it was totally freaky:,0
"it showed a tomb-stone, with the letters",0
written on it.,0
What does it mean?,1
she asked in almost a whisper.,0
Her face was white.,0
She knew what it meant.,0
"Rest In Peace,",1
replied Samantha solemnly.,0
You picked the Card of Death.,1
"Later that afternoon in class, when Miss Vile asked Jennie if she knew what was the biggest animal that ever lived on Earth, Jennie didn’t reply.",0
She didn’t even hear the question.,0
Her mind was frozen with fear.,0
"After school, people were trying to cheer her up.",0
"Ravi said,",0
"Don’t fret Jennie, perhaps it’s only your cat that’s going to die.",1
And Jennie burst into tears.,0
What’s all this nonsense about now?,1
"butted in Katie. In answer to her question, Ravi drew his finger across his throat and said",0
kikkkkkkkh,1
"And Isis whispered in her ear that Jennie had picked the Card of Death. When she heard this, Katie marched up to the culprit who was the cause of all this worry and confusion, and in a flurry of righteous fury she said:",0
"I told you, Samantha Jones, that no good would come of fortune-telling – and now look what’s happened.",1
You’ve terrified the life out of poor Jennie. You’re a dangerous amateur and you don’t know what you’re doing.,1
The Card of Death isn’t necessarily a bad one.,1
"It can mean positive things like, unexpected change, or a new beginning.",1
And how come you’re suddenly such a Miss Know-it-all about the cards?,1
demanded Samantha.,0
"Because I am,",1
stated Katie firmly.,0
"Of course, it’s an open secret that Katie is a witch, and that she knows a great deal about anything magical or mystical.",0
"And poor frightened Jennie, who was listening to all this, began to see a glimmer of hope that she might live to see her next birthday after all.",0
Katie went home with a certain satisfaction that she had been proven right.,0
But the next morning Jennie came to school looking more sad than ever.,0
"You see, it was true, her cat had died.",0
"After that, Samantha’s reputation as a mystic and fortune teller was firmly established.",0
The word reached the ear of Mrs Hepworth and she duly banned fortune telling at school.,0
Nobody was particularly surprised.,0
But even Mrs Hepworth’s stern writ did not reach into her pupil’s time at home.,0
"The following Friday was Halloween, and while the other kids went out trick-or-treating, Samantha’s best friends gathered at her house for a seance, which is like, when you try and get in touch with people who have departed this world to the other side of life.",0
"Isis, Jennie and Isabelle were there – and so was Samantha’s cousin, Mystic Maurine. They went down to the basement of Samantha’s house, which was used as a games room.",0
"The family kept things there like a ping-pong table, a bar, a football set, a wendy house, a punch ball for her brother, and a wooden puppet theatre.",0
"It was a cool hang-out, but the light was low, and at night, especially on a date like Halloween, it could be rather creepy.",0
Mystic Maureen sat at the table.,0
Before her was spread a board that depicted the Sun and the Moon encircled by letters and numbers.,0
How do you play this game?,1
"asked Jennie, a little timidly.",0
"This is no pretty game for little children, my dear,",1
"said Maureen. Although Maureen was only three years older than Samantha, she had an air of being very grown up, and seemed to model her look on a vampire.",0
"She had a pale face, straight black hair, and blood-red lipstick.",0
"To play the Ouija board, the children had to place their hands in a pile on top of a heart-shaped float.",0
Maureen asked:,0
Spirit are you with us?,1
"And the float started to skate across the board, as if propelled by a mystic power.",0
"Everyone’s hands followed, as it visited the letters Y-E-S.",0
"Spirit, do you have a message for us?",1
"For the next couple of minutes, the float spelt out the following message:",0
Beware False Magic. Beware Black Friday. Beware Beware Beware.,1
"Oh Pooh,",1
said Isis.,0
This is nonsense.,1
Suddenly the float stopped moving.,0
"The spirit is gone,",1
"said Maureen,",0
It is offended by what you said.,1
"Samantha was cross with Isis, but both Jennie and Isabelle were relieved that the spirit had departed.",0
"The girls went upstairs to drink hot chocolate, and as they sat around the rather more friendly kitchen table, they discussed what the psychic message could mean.",0
"It’s obvious,",1
said Samantha.,0
Beware False Magic,1
"– that can only mean Katie. She lets everyone think she’s a witch, but she isn’t, she’s just weird.",0
Beware Black Friday,1
"– That means Katie’s birthday, which is next Friday. Everyone should stay away from her party, because something really bad is bound to happen.",0
The spirit world is angry with her for doing false magic.,0
"The board doesn’t lie, does it Maureen?",0
I wouldn’t got to that party next Friday for love or money.,1
"On Monday, the news soon spread that some terrible catastrophe would hit Katie’s party on Friday. Katie was furious with Isis for taking part in Samantha’s seance.",0
"And Isis was furious with Katie, because she didn’t know that the Ouija board was going to say bad things about Katie’s party, and besides she had pooh-poohed it.",0
Well you didn’t pooh-pooh loud enough because everyone thinks my party’s jinxed.,1
And Isis went off in a huff because her friend was being totally unfair to her.,0
"Some people started to make excuses about not being able to come to Katie’s party – like Isabelle who said she had to go to the doctor’s, and Ravi whose aunty was suddenly having her sixtyth birthday party that night.",0
"Lots of people just didn’t say if they were coming or not, so Katie’s mother didn’t know how many chocolate toad-stools or candy-floss cobwebs to make for the party.",0
"In fact, Katie wasn’t even sure if her best friend Isis was coming, because they weren’t talking to each other.",0
"Even on Friday morning, Katie was still wondering if anybody at all would come to her party.",0
"She arrived at class feeling rather lonely and sad – but at least she wasn’t hopping mad like Samantha, because on the way to school Samantha had stepped in some dog poo.",0
"Their teacher, Miss Vile, announced that there would be a surprise Geography test, and anybody who didn’t get seven out of ten or more would have to stay in at lunch break and learn the names of the longest rivers in the world.",0
"Katie didn’t mind this at all, because Geography was one of her best subjects – but Samantha hated Geography, and she knew she would fail the test, and she duly did.",0
"After lunch, Samantha decided to put chewing gum in Katie’s chair.",0
"When Katie stood up at the end of the lesson, Samantha called out;",0
Ooh Yuck. Katie’s got chewing gum stuck to her bottom,1
– and several people laughed.,0
"Miss Vile suspected that somebody had played a trick on poor Katie, and she came round to inspect everyone’s desks.",0
"She spotted Samanatha trying to sneak a packet of chewing gum out of her desk and into her pocket, and she gave her double detention for having illegal chewing gum and for playing a mean trick.",0
"Katie ran out of school to get home quickly, get changed, and ready for her party.",0
"She was excited now, because even if none of her school friends came, at least her mum and dad and her cousins would be there.",0
Samantha was feeling more than just a bit gloomy when her mother asked her:,0
How was your day sweety?,1
And she replied:,0
Rotten.,1
Her mother said:,0
"I’m sorry darling, but I’ve got a disappointment for you.",1
Dad doesn’t want to get a puppy after all.,1
He says that a pet would be a nuisance when we want to go away on holiday.,1
"Oh Poo, Double Poo and Pants!",1
"exclaimed Samantha, because that news just about rounded off the worst Friday ever for her.",0
Meanwhile the door bell rang at Katie’s house.,0
"She ran to open it, and was given a card, a present, and a kiss by Paul, who didn’t go to her school anymore, but whom she really, really liked a lot.",0
"Soon after, Jennie rang the bell.",0
"And then Judith. And then Rishi, and then Winston. There were quite a few absences, but she knew that those who were there were her best and bravest friends.",0
"But there was no Isis. Katie was too excited to worry about no-show Isis right now, but every now and then she had a feeling that she was going to be sad later when she remembered how she had lost her best friend over a silly quarrel.",0
"But at half past six, just as Katie was about to blow out her candles, the door bell rang again, and of course it was Isis, and had spent rather a long time deciding which party frock to wear.",0
Hardly anybody was surprised because Isis was known for being late.,0
In fact she seemed to make a point of it.,0
But Katie was all the more pleased to see her friend because she hadn’t expected her.,0
"And of course nothing went wrong at Katie’s party because it wasn’t her Black Friday, but Samantha’s.",0
And that was the story of Katie’s Black Friday.,0
"Download the audio This story is full of both exciting fights and touching moments of recognition - none more so than when the faithful dog Argos, lying on dung heap, senses his master.",0
"We round off the tale with some moving verses from Ulysses by Alfred Lord Tennyson. Homecoming of Odysseus After the war ended, not all the Greeks enjoyed a pleasant homecoming.",0
"King Agamemnon went home to his Queen, the evil Clytemnestra – and while he was relaxing in his bath, she plunged a dagger into him.",0
"The cleverest of the Greeks, the wily, red-headed Odysseus spent ten more years sailing home to his lovely Queen Penelope. When we last left Odysseus, his ship had been wrecked by a storm.",0
"All his crew were drowned, but he was washed ashore, half dead.",0
"He managed to crawl to some bushes by the mouth of the river, and there he fell into a deep sleep.",0
"The island was ruled by wealthy, seafaring people.",0
"It just so happened that the King’s daughter, the lovely Nausicaa, had come down to the river with her maids.",0
"They were all playing with a ball, and it splashed into a swirling pool of the river.",0
"The maids shrieked with laughter, and their cries awoke the sleeping warrior.",0
"He clambered out of the bushes, covering his naked, sea-tossed body with leafy branches.",0
The servant girls let out squeals when they saw him – but Princess Nausicaa calmly asked him who he was and how he came to be there.,0
"The stranger replied,",0
"Princess, your beauty is so great – are you a goddess or a mere mortal?",1
"In either case, I stand here at your mercy.",1
My ship was wrecked in the great storm last night.,1
My crew are drowned and I have lost everything.,1
"For once, the long suffering Odysseus was in luck.",0
The people of the island respected all who risked their lives at sea.,0
The princess led the stranger to her father.,0
"When the king learned that their guest was Lord Odysseus on his way home from Troy, he prepared a great feast in his honour.",0
He then ordered a ship to be made ready to take him home - he filled a sea chest for him with rich gifts:,0
"sumptuous robes, a golden cauldron, and a handful of jewels.",0
"The ship carried Odysseus home to his rocky kingdom on the island of Ithaca. After twenty years away, he was far from certain what sort of welcome he would receive and so he asked to be put on shore in a quiet harbour, away from the town.",0
There he hid his sea chest in a secret cave and wrapped himself in beggar’s rags.,0
"Wearing this disguise, he climbed up a rough path.",0
He came to the part of the island where pigs were kept.,0
"As he approached the hut of the pigs’ keeper, some fierce dogs rushed out at him.",0
They were about to tear at his limbs – a fine welcome home – but just in time the keeper appeared and called them off.,0
"You should be more careful,",1
"he scolded,",0
"for the gods would be angry with me if my dogs ripped apart an innocent stranger – if you are, indeed, an innocent stranger.",1
"Odysseus recognised the man as his old servant, Eumaeus. He was a good man, and he honoured the Greek tradition of giving food and shelter to strangers.",0
"In fact, in the Greek language there was just one word for both stranger and guest – because all strangers should be honoured as guests .",0
That night the two men sat up talking.,0
"Eumaeus explained that his master was King Odysseus who had been away for twenty long years, and was almost certainly dead by now, but his loyal wife Queen Penelope would not believe it.",0
Now his palace was full of scoundrels who ate his food and drank his wine.,0
They demanded that Penelope pick one of them to marry but she refused.,0
She told them that she could not marry until she had finished sewing her wedding dress.,0
"She worked all day and every night she unpicked her work, so that it was never done.",0
"Her son, Prince Telemachus, had taken a ship and gone in search of his father – but he had found no news.",0
He was expected back any day now.,0
"The suitors of Penelope had set up a watch down at the harbour, and they planned to ambush and murder him on the road to the palace.",0
Odysseus listened to all this but did not say who he really was.,0
"The next morning, the swineherd pointed him on the road to the town.",0
"Odysseus set out and on his way he met his son, Prince Telemachus, who was smart enough to take a back route to avoid an ambush.",0
The two men walked along – a tramp and a prince side by side.,0
"Athene, the wise goddess, made Odysseus appear as his true self;",0
"younger, stronger, and richly dressed -Telemachus was amazed.",0
He realised that this sudden transformation must be the work of a god or goddess – and he understood that the man standing before him was his father who had left him as a baby.,0
"After they had embraced each other for a long time, they hatched a plan...",0
"Telemachus would return to the palace alone, and Odysseus would follow on, dressed as a beggar and accompanied by the loyal swineherd.",0
"No matter how many insults his wife’s suitors flung at him, they would keep their tempers till the moment was ripe for revenge.",0
"Later that day, Odysseus and the swineherd approached the town.",0
"On the way they were met by a man they both knew, a servant who kept the goats.",0
"When he saw the two shabbily dressed men he called out, ",0
"Keeper of Pigs, why do you drag this old corpse into our dining room?",1
Don’t we have enough beggars and pests in this town?,1
Now kindly throw him out before I do much worse to him.,1
"Eumaeus, the swineherd, replied,",0
My lord Odysseus was always kind and respectful to old soldiers who were down on their luck.,1
It is his food and wine that you are helping yourself to – and he would gladly spare a few morsels.,1
At this the leader of the suitors flew into a rage.,0
"Fine words, swineherd,",1
"he cried,",0
but this is what I think of your advice!,1
"With that, he picked up a chair and flung it at Odysseus. It hit him on the shoulder.",0
All the suitors burst out into laughter and started to pelt Odysseus and the swineherd with food.,0
"They both kept their cool, and retreated further into the palace.",0
Eumaeus found the old nurse who had looked after Odysseus as a baby.,0
"He said that the stranger was weary from tramping, and asked if she would bathe his feet.",0
She gladly fetched hot water and began to do as she was asked.,0
"As she washed him, she could not help but notice a scar on the stranger’s leg.",0
"Odysseus had gone out hunting as a young man, and the boar had charged at him and dug its tusk into his leg.",0
She recognised the scar at once.,0
"My Lord,",1
she said.,0
You are home at last.,1
Let me rush to your poor Queen and let her know this wonderful news.,1
"Hold still,",1
said Odysseus.,0
One of the servants might hear her rejoicing and my secret will be out.,1
"Don’t breathe a word to a soul, not even to fair Penelope.",1
The good old nurse swore that she would keep her master’s secret.,0
"As he walked back along the corridor, a maid spat at him and told him to get out of the palace with his begging bowl.",0
"That evening, as Odysseus was sitting on the porch of the palace, along came a real beggar, Irus, and he was a complete scoundrel – a cheat and a sneak thief.",0
He was a favourite of the suitors who recognised him as a kindred spirit.,0
"Irus was not pleased to see a rival beggar around the palace, competing with him for scraps.",0
"Get up and get out, you filthy swine!",1
he said.,0
Make yourself scarce before I box you around the ears.,1
What’s gotten into you?,1
replied Odysseus.,0
I’ve done you no harm.,1
You’d better keep your mouth shut or you’ll be the one on the wrong end of a beating.,1
Are you threatening me old man?,1
said Irus.,0
Well stand up so I can punch your lights out.,1
One of the suitors overhead the two old tramps quarrelling and thought it was hilarious.,0
He ordered them both inside so that the suitors could enjoy the spectacle of a beggar’s boxing match.,0
A space was cleared in the middle of the dining hall.,0
The suitors placed bets on which tramp would knock the other out first.,0
"Irus was the clear favourite to win, but then the two men stripped down for the fight.",0
Odysseus’ muscles glistened and all could see that he was built like an ox.,0
Irus began to tremble with fear – but it was too late.,0
The leader of the suitors whose name was Antinous swiftly changed his wager to back the newcomer.,0
"He called out to Irus,",0
"You’ve filled your fat belly with scraps from our table, old goat that you are, but now it seems you’re going to get what’s coming to you.",1
Odysseus hit Irus with a glancing blow and he was out cold.,0
The servants dragged him out by his feet and threw him on the dung heap beside the corpse of old Argos. The suitors gave Odysseus his reward for his victory:,0
scraps of meat from their plates.,0
"Antinous said to Odysseus,",0
"That was a good hit from an old swine like you, but don’t get any ideas or become above yourself, or you’ll soon be out on your ear.",1
"Later that night, Odysseus and Prince Telemachus held a secret conference.",0
This is what Odysseus told his son to do.,0
He must tell his mother to call the suitors together and tell them that she had made up her mind to hold an archery contest.,0
She would marry the man who could string her husband’s old bow and shoot the straightest arrow from it.,0
Penelope agreed to this idea because she knew that the only man who was strong enough to string her husband’s bow was her husband himself.,0
She thought the contest was a cunning way to show the suitors that not a single one among them was the equal of her true husband.,0
The next morning the suitors gathered in the dining hall for the contest.,0
"They set up a target at the end of the room, and Telemachus handed his father’s great bow to the first to try his aim - but the suitor could not even bend the bow, let alone fire it.",0
"The others all laughed at him for being so feeble, but not for long, for none of them had the strength to string the bow.",0
"At last their leader, Antinous, took it in his hands, and though he could bend it just a bit, he was far from able to hook the string over its end.",0
"Fair Penelope must be laughing up in her chamber,",1
he said.,0
"A fine trick this is of hers, for there’s no man alive who could string this bow.",1
"Then Odysseus said,",0
I was once handy with a bow and arrow.,1
I pray let me try my hand.,1
"The suitors all laughed at the tramp’s boast, but Antinous said,",0
Certainly. If you string the bow for me I will reward you with gold.,1
"If not, I shall beat you within an inch of your useless old life.",1
"At this, Odysseus picked up the bow and tried it for weight, balancing it in his hand.",0
The suitors mocked him for this display.,0
"Thinks he’s an expert, he does,",1
they jeered.,0
Then he placed the bow upright on the ground.,0
"He leaned into it, and hooked the string over the end with ease.",0
"At first the suitors were astounded, and then they realised that the beggar was the king whose palace and hospitality they had been abusing, and whose wife they had been wooing.",0
"The realisation came too late to save their skins, for Odysseus was soon letting arrows fly from the bow, picking them off one by one.",0
One of the suitors who was better mannered than the others tried to bargain with the king.,0
He swore that if he would spare their lives they would pay him back three times over for what they had taken.,0
Odysseus replied that if they wanted to save their lives they had better fight.,0
"Several men charged at him with their swords, but Odysseus was swift at letting the arrows fly.",0
"And so Odysseus and his son, Telemachus, dealt with all the suitors.",0
At the end of the battle not one was left alive.,0
"Now Odysseus told his son to fetch Penelope, but when Penelope saw her husband she could not be sure after so many years that it was really him.",0
"Dearest Queen, how can you be so hard hearted when you see your husband here before you after twenty long years?",1
pleaded Odysseus. Penelope still was not sure whether or not to believe her own eyes so she decided to test him.,0
She called the old nurse and told her to move the bed out of their room and prepare it for the stranger in the next room along the corridor.,0
How can that be?,1
asked Odysseus.,0
"If it is my bed then nobody could move it for I made it myself, and one of its pillars is the olive tree that grew on this spot where I built the bedroom with my own hands.",1
"Then Penelope knew that the man before her truly was her husband, Lord Odysseus, for whom she had waited twenty long years.",0
She threw her arms around him and wept for joy.,0
"And that’s the story over the homecoming of Odysseus. It is also the end of the tales from the Trojan war as told by the Greek bard, Homer, who wrote two epic poems called the Iliad and the Odyssey. Although our hero was overjoyed to be home, that was not the end of his travels - for Odysseus always longed to go and see new places, and after some time he again set out.",0
The English Poet Lord Alfred Tennyson (in a poem called Ulysses – another name for Odysseus) wrote a few lines about his unquenchable urge to sail the seas:,0
"Katie’s Revenge is a little darker and deeper than most of our Katie stories, and it has a moral dilemma for you to contemplate.",0
Katie and the Witch’s Swap is rather lighter and more cheerful – and is one of our top favourite stories ...,0
so don’t miss it.,0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration eighteen.thirty-four.,0
Katie and her best friend Isis were really not at all like each other in so many ways.,0
Isis was neat and tidy and Katie was rather messy.,0
"Isis was sporty, and liked swimming and gymnastics, and Katie liked reading books and drawing pictures.",0
"Isis was pretty and popular, and Katie looked a bit out-of-the ordinary, and lots of people thought she was weird because they had heard that her mother was a witch.",0
"But Isis had friends who didn’t like Katie, and Katie had friends who didn’t like Isis. Take Samantha for example.",0
"She was one of the most fashion-conscientious and trendy girls in class – and so naturally, she was friends with Isis. But she hated Katie, and she began to get annoyed with Isis for spending so much time with the strangest girl in school.",0
"In fact, she felt quite insulted really.",0
Why did Isis sit next to Katie and not her at lunchtime?,0
Why did Isis say that she couldn’t come over to Samantha’s house because she was going to the cinema with Katie and her mother who was a witch?,0
She decided that she didn’t like Isis anymore.,0
"She decided that Isis needed to be taken down a peg or two, because she had bad taste in her friends.",0
"And she also decided that, if anybody asked, who was the most popular, brainy, and best dressed girl in school, people shouldn’t point to Isis, but to Samantha. But Isis didn’t even have an inkling that her friend was thinking any of this – not yet at any rate.",0
"So as they were leaving school one Friday, she said to Samantha:",0
Why do we have to read such boring books for English?,1
I’m going to spend all Sunday afternoon ploughing through chapter nine of The Adventurous Six and it’s so dull that I will keep falling asleep and it will take simply ages to finish.,1
"And Samantha, seeing an opportunity to make mischief, said:",0
"Oh I already read chapter nine, so don’t bother reading it, because I’ll tell you what happened.",1
"As bad luck would have it, on Monday Miss Vile asked Isis to stand up in front of the class and summarise chapter nine.",0
"As Isis hadn’t actually read it, she felt a bit put on the spot, but she glanced at Samantha who gave her the thumbs up.",0
She launched into what her friend had told her to say:,0
"This was a very exciting chapter in which the heroine, Jemima, was kidnapped by robbers on the way to school, and her dad had to pay one million dollars to get her back.",1
I liked this chapter because it was full of suspense and intrigue.,1
"The teacher glared and said,",0
Isis – Did you read chapter nine at the weekend?,1
"No Miss Vile,",1
admitted Isis with her eyes downcast.,0
Then why did you just make up that perfect load of old nonsense?,1
"I don’t know Miss Vile,",1
"said Isis, covered in shame.",0
You don’t know......,1
"Well I know that you can stay in on Friday evening and do detention while you read Chapters nine and ten,",1
said Miss Vile.,0
 And you can write out a detailed summary for me of both chapters.,1
"Isis sat down at her desk and fumed at Samantha. Later, when she had asked her why she had tricked her, she just said,",0
"Well it’s your fault for being too lazy to read the book,",1
and all Isis could do was to gnash her perfect pearly teeth.,0
"So when she got home, she rang her real best friend:",0
"Katie, help me get my revenge on Samantha,",1
she said.,0
"Think of the meanest, nastiest, stinkiest magic spell in the book and do it against Samantha with all your might.",1
But Katie replied:,0
I’m sorry Isis. I don’t do black magic.,1
My mum will only let me use my powers for good.,1
"Alright, well if that’s the way it is,",1
"said Isis,",0
"then, I’ll just have to get my own revenge.",1
"Remember, two wrongs don’t make a right,",1
"said Katie, but Isis didn’t hear her, because she had already hung up her phone.",0
"And now she was really, really angry, not just with Samantha, but with her best friend for not helping her out in her hour of need.",0
"But just as she was slipping the book back into the desk, Samantha said:",0
"Isis, what were you doing with my work?",1
"And Isis, who was totally taken aback, said:",0
Nothing.,1
And Samantha yelled:,0
"Yes, you were, you were writing in my English book.",1
I just came in now and saw you!,1
"I wouldn’t touch your smelly English book in case I caught something off it,",1
said Isis. And Isis felt quite afraid about what she might do.,0
"She was almost relieved that Miss Vile chose that moment to come into the room, and Samantha had to back off.",0
"But then Samantha told Miss Vile what she had seen Isis doing, and her book was taken out and examined, and the teacher spotted the underlined letters and said:",0
"Isis, was it you who did this?",1
And Isis said:,0
"Yes, Miss Vile.",1
"And now she was in double detention on Friday, and even worse, Miss Vile wrote a letter to Isis’s mum explaining how badly behaved her daughter had been recently, and a warning that she was heading for serious trouble.",0
The first thing Isis noticed about her tie was that it felt greasy.,0
"Then, she saw it was all stained and thought that it must be somebody else’s – but it couldn’t have been – because it had her name sewn on the back.",0
"She did her best to wash it under the tap, but the stains wouldn’t come out.",0
"When she came into class, Tabatha said:",0
"Oooh, look Samantha, Isis is a messy eater.",1
And Samantha said:,0
"Well that’s hardly surprising, since her best friend is Katie who can’t even tuck her own shirt in.",1
"That evening, Isis rang up Katie in tears and said:",0
"Please Katie, please help me.",1
Miss Vile has got me on her watch-list.,1
My mother thinks I’ve become a problem child.,1
And none of my friends are talking to me.,1
You’ve got to help me.,1
"I know that revenge is bad, but I’m not talking about revenge – I’m talking about justice.",1
It can’t be right to let Samantha get away with all these mean tricks.,1
I’ve always stuck up for you.,1
"Now you’ve got to stick up for me, or you are no true friend.",1
"And Katie, who really did feel sorry to see her best friend in such trouble, swore that she really was her friend, and that she would do anything she could – but not black magic.",0
"said her mother,",0
It’s always wrong to use magic to hurt somebody.,1
That’s what gives witches a bad name.,1
And Katie protested:,0
"But it can’t be right to stand by and watch all these bad things being done to my best friend, can it?",1
"The next morning before school, she saw Isis in the playground.",0
"At that moment, Isis was texting her gran, and Katie thought:",0
I know who has a phone just like that....,1
And she said to Isis:,0
I’ve got an idea.,1
I won’t tell you what it is now.,1
Just wait and see.,1
It won’t be long now.,1
"In class, just before break, Katie quietly said the words of a little magic spell that made Miss Vile take her phone out of her bag, put it on her desk, and then leave it there.",0
"As soon as everyone else was out of the room, Katie took Miss Vile’s phone and put it on Isis’s desk.",0
"Then she went out into the playground and said another little spell to make Samantha go back into the classroom to fetch her woolly hat, because it was winter and it was cold outside.",0
She knew that Samantha would see the phone.,0
She knew she would think it belonged to Isis. And she knew exactly what mean thing she would do.,0
Samantha picked it up and started to text all the names in the phone’s memory with messages like:,0
I hate you because you are a silly cow.,1
Your face is an official disaster zone.,1
I hope you leave soon and don’t come back.,1
She sent a nasty message to everyone in the address book.,0
"She thought they would all see Isis’s name and number flash up, and assume that it was from her....",0
and then all her friends would be angry with her.,0
"In the staff room, Mr Brain, the maths teacher said:",0
"Violet, did you just send me a text?",1
"And Violet, better known as Miss Vile, said:",0
No. I think I left my phone in the class room.,1
And Mr Philpots said:,0
I just got one too.,0
It says:,0
Hop off you smelly toad.,1
And Mrs Jones said:,0
I think one of the kids has got hold of your phone and is playing a prank.,1
And of course Miss Vile was back in the classroom in a flash.,0
Samantha was caught red handed with the teacher’s phone in her hand.,0
It didn’t help her case when she said that she had thought it belonged to Isis. It was still one of the meanest tricks that anyone had ever played in school.,0
"At lunchtime, Isis could hardly disguise her delight.",0
She held Katie’s hands and said:,0
So you did do a spell against Samantha....after all.,1
Thank you Thank you.,1
You’re the best friend ever.,1
"And that Friday, while Katie went to tea at Isis’s house, Samantha did a double detention, and Miss Vile sat down to write a very long letter to Samantha’s parents telling them that their daughter must mend her mean ways or else.",0
"Dear Listener’s, The character of Isis has to step up to the challenge of making Katie help her in her hour of need by using her magic witch powers effectively against the mean and cruel Samantha. Katie after consulting with her mum, finds a really good way of tricking Samantha by leaving Miss Vile’s phone on the desk, which she knows Samantha will steal, as a result she gets a double detention.",0
"I particularly like this chapter as we see the relationship between Katie and her mum evolving as she wisely guides Katie with her mystic witch’s wisdom, that leaves me wondering how Katie’s path to witch-hood will turn out but with her best friend Isis Im sure she’ll find a way.",0
"I hope you enjoy listening to it, and of course the previous Katie and The Witch’s Swap story available as a Digital App. There will be more Katie Stories that I look forward to reading and hearing your comments on.",0
So do drop me a line and Ill get back to you.,0
"In the mean time this PCR goes out to Emma K, my best friend from school, who know’s all about time keeping and the rules.",0
Bye Bye And hear from you soon N *,0
"The town musicians of Bremen are a donkey, a cockerel (rooster), a dog and a cat.",0
This amusing story by the Brothers Grimm is about four farm animals who are convinced they can earn a good living as musicians.,0
"Indeed they do, but it isn’t really the sweetness of their barking, braying, mewing, and cockle-doodle-doing, that earns them their supper – it’s more the terror of the sound they make!",0
Theme:,0
respect for our elders.,0
"The animals in the story are old, and have put in long years of hard work, but now their owners think they are no use anymore and want to get rid of them - is that fair?",0
"A bronze statue of the Town Musicians of Bremen was erected in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three in front of the City Hall in Bremen. German veterinary schools also have statues of the animal musicians.",0
"Another replica of the statue can be found in the Lynden Sculpture Garden, located in Milwaukee. Bremen is a city in the North of Germany on the River Weser, thirty-seven miles from the North Sea. Die Stadtmusikanten A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn sacks to the mill loyally for many a long year;",0
"but his strength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit for work.",0
His master began to wonder if it was worth his while by keeping this old donkey much longer.,0
"The donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to Bremen.",0
"There,",1
"he thought,",0
I can surely be town musician.,1
"When he had walked some distance, he found a dog lying on the road, gasping like one who had run until he was tired.",0
"What are you gasping so for, you big fellow?",1
Asked the donkey.,0
"replied the dog,",0
"as I am old, and grow weaker daily;",1
I can no longer hunt.,1
"My master wanted to kill me, so I ran away, but now how am I to earn my bread?",1
"I’ll tell you what,",1
"said the donkey,",0
"I am going to Bremen, and shall be a town musician there;",1
come with me and work also as a musician.,1
"I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettledrum.",1
"The dog agreed, and so on they went.",0
"Not before long they came to a cat, sitting on the path with a face like three rainy days!",0
"Now then, old fluff and claws, what has gone so wrong with you?",1
Asked the donkey.,0
Who can be merry when his neck is in danger?,1
Answered the cat.,0
"Because I am now getting old, my teeth are worn to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice.",1
"My mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away.",1
Now good advice is scarce.,1
Where am I to go?,1
Go with us to Bremen. You understand night music so you can be a town musician.,1
The cat thought well of it and decided to go with them.,0
"After this the three runaways came to a farmyard, where the cockerel was sitting upon the gate, cock-a-doodle-doing with all his might.",0
"Your cock-a-doodle-do goes through and through my skull,",1
said the donkey.,0
What is the matter?,1
"Guests are coming on Sunday and the housewife has no pity,",1
"said the cockerel,",0
"and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup tomorrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off.",1
Now I am cock-a-doodle-doing at full pitch while I can.,1
"Ah you red-headed bird,",1
"said the donkey,",0
you had better come away with us.,1
We are going to Bremen;,1
you can find something better than death everywhere.,1
"You have a good voice, and if we make music together it must have some quality!",1
"The cockerel agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.",0
"They could not, however, reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to pass the night.",0
"The donkey and the dog laid themselves down under a large tree, the cat and cockerel settled themselves in the branches – but the cockerel flew right to the top, where he was most safe.",0
"Before he went to sleep, he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a light.",0
The donkey said:,0
"If so, we had better get up and go on, for the shelter here is bad.",1
The dog thought that a few bones with some meat on would do him good too!,0
"So they moved further on, and soon saw the light shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to a well lit robber’s house.",0
"The donkey, as the biggest, went to the window and looked in:",0
"What do you see, my grey horse?",1
Asked the cockerel.,0
What do I see?,1
Answered the donkey.,0
"A table covered with good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.",1
"That would be just the sort of thing for us,",1
said the cockerel.,0
"Yes, yes.",1
"Ah, how I wish we were there!",1
Said the donkey.,0
Then the animals put their heads together and schemed how to best win an invitation to come inside and join the robbers at the table.,0
"Come, come my friends,",1
said the donkey.,0
"We are musicians, so let us sing for our supper.",1
They began to perform their music together:,0
"The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cockerel cock-a-doodle-do’ed.",0
"Then they burst through the window into the room, so that the glass clattered!",0
"At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise than a ghost had come in, and they fled in a great fright out into the forest.",0
"The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with what was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month.",0
"As soon as the four musicians had done, they put out the light, and each found a sleeping place according to his nature and to what suited him.",0
"The donkey laid himself down upon some straw in the yard, the dog behind the door, the cat upon the hearth near the warm ashes, and the cockerel perched himself upon a beam of the roof;",0
"and being tired from their long walk, they soon went to sleep.",0
"When it was past midnight, the robbers saw from afar that the light was no longer burning in their house.",0
"Appearing quiet, the captain said:",0
"We ought not to have let ourselves be frightened out of our wits,",1
and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.,0
"The messenger finding all was still, went into the kitchen to light a candle, and taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals, he held the candle to them to light it.",0
"The cat did not understand what he meant to do, however, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching.",0
"He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back door, but the dog, who lay there sprang up and bit his leg.",0
"As he ran across the yard by the straw heap, the donkey gave him a smart kick with its hind foot.",0
"The cockerel too, who had been awakened by the noise, had become lively, and cried down from the beam,",0
Cock-a-doodle-doo!,1
Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain and said:,0
"Ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who spat on me and scratched my face with her long claws;",0
"and by the door stands a man with a knife who stabbed me in the leg, and in the yard there lies a monster who beat me with a wooden club.",0
"Above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who called out:",0
Bring the rogue here to me!,1
So I got away as well as I could.,0
"Download the audio Click picture to enlarge Read by Natasha.  Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. One Saturday morning, Mandy and Laura were sitting around the kitchen table drinking coffee and having an argument.",0
"Mandy thought that she ought to be the leader of the chiX, because she was the oldest, and more importantly, she was the best at getting things organised.",0
Laura thought that she should be the leader because she had friends in the music business.,0
"Kevin isn’t in the music business,",1
said Mandy.,0
He’s just a loser who sweeps up in a recording studio.,1
"That’s just like you,",1
"said Laura,",0
You won’t give anybody any credit unless it’s yourself.,1
Kevin’s a studio producer and a musical whiz-kid.,1
"Well just because you met the guy at a bus stop doesn’t mean that you’re a musical genius too,",1
said Mandy.,0
"Yeah, but I’ve got contacts.",1
"Besides, Kev said I’ve got a great voice.",1
"Yeah, but Kev says that to all the girls.",1
"Besides, what this band needs is somebody to call the right shots and make the right decisions.",1
"Exactly, that’s why I should be leader,",1
"said Laura,",0
because I know more about the music business than you do.,1
"Mandy pointed out that she was the one who had set up their web page on Myspace, and that Laura had been promising to ask her friend, Kev, for a recording session at his studio for two weeks now, and she still hadn’t fixed it.",0
"Laura said that was because Kev was super busy recording lots of big stars, and he was fitting them in for free as a special favour for her.",0
"Still, she decided to give him a prompt.",0
She took out her mobile phone and sent him a text message:,0
Hey whiz-kid.,1
Got time yet to give three gals a helping hand?,1
And Kev texted back:,0
"Sure, next week’s looking good.",1
Come over Tues.,1
So the chiX had their first recording session set up for three days’ time.,0
"When Gladdy heard, she pointed out that they didn’t have a tune for their song, let alone any backing music.",0
"That’s Kev’s job,",1
said Laura.,0
He just presses some buttons on his recording desk and pulls some levers.,1
He’s a genius at that sort of thing.,1
He even made the Diamond Girls sound half decent.,1
Gladys tried to imagine the chiX turning up at the recording studio and asking Kevin to do everything for them.,0
She thought it sounded a bit unlikely that he would just say:,0
"Sure girls, here’s a number one hit single that I just wrote yesterday especially for you.",1
"If it was that easy,",1
"she said,",0
everyone would be stars.,1
"Yeah, but not everyone is mates with Kevin,",1
said Laura.,0
"Besides, not everyone’s got star quality like the chiX.",1
"After school on Tuesday evening, the girls took the train up to London. Gladys came too, because although she wasn’t in the band, somebody had to look after her as she was still too young to be on her own at home.",0
"In fact, Gladys knew that she could look after herself better than the sisters, but that was how things were.",0
"When they got to London, they took the underground train to the station called Goodge Street, which Laura said was in the swanky part of town.",0
"In fact, when they got out it looked pretty grotty to Gladys. Keven’s studio was on the fifth floor of a tall office building.",0
It was about the size of their bathroom at home.,0
"Nice,",1
"he said, when he had read them,",0
and what’s the music?,1
"Ah right,",1
"said Laura,",0
we were kind of hoping that you’d help us out with that bit.,1
Seeing as you’re such a whiz-kid.,1
Kevin blinked.,0
Gladys could see that he was trying not to look too surprised.,0
After a pause he said:,0
Right girls.,1
Go behind the soundproof glass and put some headphones on.,1
"I’ll play you some loops, and we’ll see if we can build up a sound just for you.",1
Gladys knew that loops were some drum beats and other bits of music that were already recorded on the computer.,0
"They were called loops because they went round and round, and when you got to the end of say thirty seconds, the music started at the beginning again.",0
"She had been experimenting with some loops at home, and she had also been recording some music of her own using an electronic keyboard.",0
"After she had put the notes onto the computer, she could make them sound like almost any instrument.",0
Kevin pressed a drum beat.,0
"Too grungy,",1
said Laura through the microphone.,0
The chiX are kind of a bit funkier than that.,1
So Kevin let them hear something a bit more polished.,0
"Not really,",1
said Mandy.,0
"The chiX are kind of a mix of different musical styles and influences, if you see what I mean.",1
Yeah. Find us something that’s just right.,1
said Sam. So Kevin looked at the computer and scrolled through a few more tracks until he found one thing he thought they might like.,0
How about this one girls?,1
he asked.,0
Yikes!,1
Are you sure your mate knows what he’s doing?,1
asked Mandy to Laura. She didn’t realise that the microphone was switched on and Kevin could hear her.,0
Gladys thought she could see hot steam coming out of his ears.,0
The sisters heard the music through their headphones and started to groove about.,0
"Yeah, that’s more like it, Kev,",1
said Laura.,0
We could do something with that.,1
"Hey Gladdy, leave Kevin alone and let him get on with his job,",1
said Mandy. But Kevin replied that he was alright about showing Gladys how his mixing desk worked.,0
"Much later that evening, after quite a few tries, the ChiX made the first song of their career.",0
"And though they didn’t know it yet, the music was written by Gladys with only a little help from Kevin.",0
Circe ranks as one of the greatest witches of mythology.,0
A beautiful enchantress - she likes nothing better than to turn men into pigs.,0
(Some have seen her as a bit of a feminist).,0
It is only when the wily Odysseus lands on her island that she finally meets her match.,0
"Circe the Beautiful Witch - Now he and his men sailed on across the wine dark sea, until once again they caught sight of an island.",0
"They slipped their boat into a snug little harbour, and there they slept for two whole days.",0
"The following morning, Odysseus said they should explore the island and discover who lived there.",0
"At these words, his men grew afraid.",0
"They remembered the terrible Cyclops who had kept them prisoner in his cave, and had devoured some of their companions.",0
"Odysseus divided his men into two groups, so that if one should get into trouble, the other could come and help.",0
"He was leader of one group, and Lord Eurylochus (Yuri-Locus) was the leader of the other.",0
"They drew straws to see which group should go and explore first, and as Eurylochus drew the short straw, he and his men had to set out and explore the woods.",0
"After walking two or three hours, the men came to a clearing.",0
"They saw a little house surrounded by wild beasts – wolves, leopards, and lions.",0
"One of the leopards sprang towards Eurylochus. He thought that he was about to die, but instead of eating him, the leopard rubbed up against him like a cat and purred.",0
"The window of the house was open, and inside a woman was singing.",0
"Her voice was mysterious but very beautiful, and the men felt themselves being drawn towards the house, for they all longed to see if the woman was as wonderful as her voice.",0
"They walked past the fierce looking beasts, who in fact were really quite tame.",0
"Inside they were greeted by a tall and elegant woman, her black hair done up in braids – she did indeed look very lovely.",0
Her name was Circe (Sir-see) and she invited the men to sit down at her table and drink some of her soup – they readily agreed.,0
"As they drank the soup, Eurylochus said:",0
"When I drew the short straw I cursed my bad luck, but how wrong I was!",1
"Our hostess is not so terrible after all, eh men?",1
"They did not realise that though she was beautiful, Circe was in fact a witch.",0
"She had slipped a magic potion into their soup, and when they had finished drinking it, she rapped the table with a magic wand and said:",0
"Now you swine, be off to the pigsty where you belong.",1
The men looked up astonished.,0
Madam – Did you just call us pigs?,1
"asked Eurylochus. But Circe just laughed in reply, for the nose of Eurylochus was already growing into a pink snout, and his hands were becoming hairy trotters.",0
"In fact, all his men were swiftly turning into pigs.",0
"They tried to weep and cry out, but all they could do was to snort and squeal.",0
"Now do as I say,",1
cried Circe.,0
"Pigs belong in the sty, not in my kitchen.",1
Be off with you!,1
And off they trotted to their new home.,0
"When the men did not return to the ship, Odysseus grew worried, and he decided to go and search for them.",0
He set out across the island in the direction of the smoke he had seen from the cottage.,0
"While he was walking through the woods, he met a young man – more of a boy, whose beard was still soft and downy on his face.",0
"Stranger, what are you doing here?",1
asked the young man.,0
"I’m going in search of my men who are lost,",1
said Odysseus.,0
"No doubt they are guests of the lovely Circe. You won’t find them in her house, but outside in the pigsty.",1
"Beautiful though she is, she is really a witch and she turns men into beasts.",1
"If you step inside her house, she will turn you into a pig too.",1
My men – turned into pigs!,1
exclaimed Odysseus.,0
Is this how you treat guests on this island?,1
"The young man did not reply, but took a small plant out of his knapsack and handed it to Odysseus. Its stem was black and its flower was as white as milk.",0
"Eat this,",1
he said.,0
It will make you safe against all magic tricks and potions.,1
The name of this plant is molly.,1
"It is dangerous for mere mortals to pluck, for only gods can take it out of the ground safely.",1
"When he spoke these words, Odysseus realised that this was no ordinary young man, but Hermes the messenger of the gods.",0
He ate the molly plant and went on his way.,0
Soon he came to the house in the woods that was guarded by wild beasts.,0
"Circe’s lovely singing voice drifted out through the window, and Odysseus walked boldly past the beasts and into the house.",0
"Inside he was greeted by the beautiful witch, who told him to sit down and try some of her soup.",0
"While she was heating it, she slipped some magic potion into the broth, for she intended to turn Odysseus into a pig like the others.",0
"She gave the soup to him, he drank it all down, and then she took out her wand and rapped the table with it.",0
"Now be off with you to the sty, pig-face,",1
she cried.,0
"Odysseus did not turn into a pig, but instead leapt to his feet, drew his sword and rushed at Circe. She, terrified, let out a shriek and fell to his feet begging for mercy.",0
Please great Lord – do not take such offence.,1
It was just my strange sense of humour.,1
"It comes from living alone for so long, here in the woods with nothing but wild beasts for company.",1
It is many years since I have seen a strong brave man like you.,1
"Come, let me kiss you...",1
"Odysseus let the beautiful witch kiss him, but all the time he was watching to see that she did not try any more of her tricks.",0
She called her servant girls and commanded them to prepare a bath for their visitor.,0
They brought hot and cold water and mixed the bath until it was just right.,0
"When Odysseus had bathed and rested, he found that they had prepared a delicious meal for him.",0
"Come, why do you look so sad?",1
asked Circe.,0
Let us eat together and wash the food down with honeyed wine.,1
"How can a leader eat,",1
"asked Odysseus,",0
when he knows that his companions are living outside in the muddy pigsty?,1
"When he spoke these words, Circe knew that there was no use pretending any longer that she was anything other than a witch.",0
She went out to the pigsty and rubbed a magic ointment onto the animals.,0
"Then she waved her wand and they began to change back into men, only younger and better looking than they were before.",0
"They began to weep, for what they had been through was truly terrible.",0
"When they had recovered, Odysseus went back to the ship to fetch the rest of his men.",0
They were all united at Circe’s house and sat down to a wonderful feast of celebration.,0
The Greeks stayed with the witch Circe for an entire month – and she didn’t try any more of her magic tricks on them.,0
One morning Odysseus spoke to her:,0
Oh beautiful enchantress – too long have we enjoyed your hospitality.,1
"We must continue our journey to our home on the rocky island of Ithaca, but unfortunately we are completely lost.",1
We do not know these seas.,1
Can you direct us by the safest route?,1
Circe replied:,0
"Lord Odysseus, if it were up to me, I would keep you here always – but I understand that you must be on your way to your home and your lovely wife, Queen Penelope. There is no safe route for you and your men to return home;",1
"for when you leave here, you must pass through a narrow passage between the rocks of Scylla and the whirlpool of Charybdis. Both are perilous – for Scylla is a many armed monster who yelps like a dog.",1
"If you sail close to her cliffs, she will reach down and grab some of your men and shove them into her mouth.",1
"But if you sail too close to the whirlpool of Charybdis, your entire boat will be sunk down to the bottom of the sea and all of you will drown.",1
It is a terrible choice to make but you are a leader – so plot your course as you see best.,1
"Next, if the gods permit you to pass through that dire strait, you will come to the island of the Sun where the great Sun God, Lord Apollo, keeps his herd of sacred cows.",1
Do as I say – steer clear of the island and do not land there.,1
Nothing and nobody escapes the eyes of Apollo as he looks down from the sky.,1
"If you value your lives, avoid his island!",1
So Odysseus and his men said farewell to the lovely Circe and sailed on their way.,0
"After three days, just as she had foretold, they reached the narrow passage that she had described.",0
"Up on the cliffs they could hear the monster Scylla, yelping like a dog that has been left tied up for too long.",0
"As they drew nearer, they could hear the terrible gurgling sound of the whirlpool, Charybdis.",0
This is indeed a terrible choice,1
", thought Odysseus,",0
"but is it a lesser evil to lose some of my men, than for all of us to drown?",1
I must therefore chart my course closer to the cliffs than the whirlpool.,1
"He did not tell his men about Scylla, in case they lost heart and put down their oars.",0
"All his men’s eyes were on the dreadful whirlpool, gurgling like a cauldron.",0
"The men rowed as hard they could, but as they passed beneath Scylla, she reached down to the ship.",0
"Odysseus fought her with his spear, desperately trying to stab at her arms, but he could not prevent her from snatching up six of his men.",0
"The others rowed on, crying for their companions.",0
"Once they passed through the strait, they saw the island of the Sun, just as Circe had predicted.",0
Thank heavens for land!,1
cried the men.,0
Odysseus tried to tell them it was no good.,0
"They must not land, but sail on – for Circe had warned him of terrible danger should they set foot on the island belonging to the great Sun God, Lord Apollo.",0
Are you a slave driver?,1
cried out Lord Eurylochus.,0
"In your rush to reach home, you deny us all rest.",1
We are still grieving for our six lost companions.,1
You cannot order us to sail on.,1
We will surely die of sadness and exhaustion.,1
"Seeing that the men meant rebellion, Odysseus allowed the ship to land with great misgiving in his heart.",0
"They found that the island was covered in green fields, and that fat cattle were grazing.",0
The men waited for Odysseus to fall asleep and then killed two cows and ate roast meat on the beach.,0
"When the sun rose in the morning, bright Apollo saw what they had done, and said to Zeus, who is Lord of all the gods:",0
Great Lord – I am wronged.,1
"Those rascals and ruffians who crew the ship of that tricky Greek, Odysseus, have killed the sacred cattle that bring joy to my heart.",1
"If you will not punish them, I shall go down to the land of the dead and light up the gloomy underworld.",1
No more shall I shine in the skies above the world.,1
When Zeus heard these words he replied:,0
It is indeed a crime to take what rightly belongs the gods.,1
"When these men set sail tomorrow, I shall hit their boat with a burning thunderbolt.",1
"The next day, Odysseus told his men to set sail.",0
"When they were out at sea, the sun disappeared behind a black cloud.",0
"The dark skies filled with lightening and an electric flash shot down from the hand of Lord Zeus and hit their boat, ripping it into two.",0
All the men fell into the raging sea.,0
"Odysseus clung for his life to the broken mast of the ship, and somehow survived the storm.",0
"The sun shone once again on the now calm waters, and Odysseus saw land.",0
"Using his last strength, he swam into the shore and staggered onto the beach, where he fell down, exhausted.",0
"Bertie, the guiding spirit of Storynory, is a frog who likes to tell stories about the time when he was a human prince.",0
"His adventures range far and wide, and this one is no exception.",0
"We learn how when Bertie was a teenage prince, the King was afraid that he was growing into a ""softy"".",0
"In order to toughen him up, he packed Bertie off to a boot camp in Scotland. We think Bertie's back on form with this story, and we hope that you are going to enjoy it!",0
Read by Natasha.Story by Bertie. Duration sixteen.forty.,0
"When Bertie was a small wee prince, his father, the king, was planning to pack him off to a boarding school in Scotland. The king had been to that boarding school, and the king’s father had been to it, and his grandfather...",0
"Not to mention his great grandfather, and his great great grandfather, and who had also been school captain.",0
"All of them had suffered terribly at that school and had absolutely hated it, but naturally, they sent their sons there because it was the family tradition.",0
"Fortunately, Bertie’s mother was still alive in those days, and she said,",0
"Absolutely not,",1
Not on your nelly.,1
"She made the king promise never to send Bertie to boarding school, and as the king kept his promises, he didn’t, even after the queen passed up to a higher kingdom.",0
And so Bertie went to the day school in the palace.,0
"One afternoon, when Bertie was already a teenage prince, the king came to watch him play in a school soccer match.",0
Bertie was in goal.,0
"It wasn’t his normal position, but the regular keeper was in the hospital with frostbite, and Bertie was absolutely frozen.",0
"The king thought,",0
"My boy looks a bit pathetic hopping up and down like a rabbit on the goal line,",1
"When Prince Boris came running into the penalty box with the ball at his feet, the king shouted,",0
"Bertie, come out,",1
"and Bertie dived towards the ball, but Boris 'accidentally on purpose' kicked Bertie’s head and scored in the corner of the net before doing a cartwheel, while his father, the Grand Duke Von Clutterbuck shouted,",0
Great shot Boris. Now put another one past that weedy keeper.,1
There was a cut above Bertie’s eye and he was quite dazed.,0
"The teacher shouted,",0
"Play on, it’s just a scratch.",1
Bertie was so dizzy that he tripped over a blade of grass and Boris easily scored a second goal.,0
"In fact, by the time of the final whistle, the score was five-nil.",0
"That evening, when the king was sitting by the fire with the wicked queen, he said,",0
Do you know.,1
m rather worried that Bertie’s turning out to be a bit of a softy.,0
"So am I. So am I,"" sympathised the wicked stepmother, who was a very different character from Bertie’s real mother, and greatly regretted that Bertie wasn’t away at boarding school.",0
"She went on, ",0
"Did you hear my dear, that after your old school was closed down for cruelty to children, it reopened as an exclusive, five star, all-inclusive, boot camp?"" ",0
"A boot camp,",1
echoed the king.,0
"Do you mean it puts on lots of healthy activities like obstacle courses, cold baths, cross country runs?",1
That sort of thing?,1
"Exactly,",1
said the queen.,0
"Just the ticket for a boy who's going a bit soft,",1
agreed the king.,0
And so it was.,0
"With the best of intentions, the king booked Bertie into the boot camp, because of course, it wasn’t boarding school – but it was the next worst thing.",0
"It was summer in the highlands of Scotland, which meant that when it wasn’t raining, clouds of midges descended from the sky and ate you alive.",0
"The water in the loch was so cold that if you went swimming in it, you would come out looking like the Loch Ness Monster. The windows in the old school house were so drafty, that at night it sounded like a pack of ghosts was trying to get in.",0
"In fact, it was just the perfect setting for an all-inclusive boot camp.",0
"Prince Boris’ father, who liked to keep up with the latest trends in the palace, sent his son there too, which was doubly unfortunate because you see, Bertie couldn’t stand Boris. Dear Major Tim, I commend to your care my stepson, Prince Bertie. Hitherto he has led a sheltered life within the confines of our palace.",0
It is His Majesty the King’s fear that Bertie is turning into a softy.,0
We require a SHORT SHARP SHOCK to straighten him out.,0
Please provide him with your FULLEST service.,0
Yours Hilda HR P.S. Give him HELL. Major Tim had two sorts of clients.,0
"Some were tough kids who had been in trouble with the law, and the authorities sent them to his camp to see if a taste of the outdoors would sort them out.",0
"Others were from rich families and had parents like fashion designers, celebrity chefs, and retired rock stars.",0
Normally Major Tim mixed his clients together so that they got to know people from different backgrounds.,0
"But this time he decided to do things a bit differently, as Prince Bertie discovered when he arrived the next day.",0
Hi there.,1
"I’m Prince Bertie,",1
"said our hero, as he threw his rucksack onto to a metal bunk bed.",0
A boy with an extremely short haircut stared at him as if he was an alien from out of space.,0
"He jabbed a finger in the direction of Bertie and said,",0
Did I ken ye right?,1
Your first name is Prince?,1
Ah actually no.,1
My first name is Bertie. I’m a prince.,1
"You can call me just Bertie,",1
I’ll call you what I like.,1
Do ye ken?,1
"Ah, yes.",1
I think I do.,1
"And my name is Hans,",1
said a tall boy with a strong German accent.,0
"""I will call you Prince Scum because that is a name that I like very much, HA!"" Half a dozen voices laughed and said,",0
Good one Hans!,1
"Because all the others in the group were tough kids, and they didn’t have very high regard for princes.",0
"When Bertie went out of the dorm to go to the bathroom, he wisely stopped outside the door and listened to what the boys inside were saying about him.",0
He heard Hans’s voice.,0
I have a funny joke.,1
"In the middle of the night, we will tie Prince Scum to the bed with a climbing rope, and shave off all his hair.",1
There was general laughter around the room because everyone clearly thought that would be a jolly funny joke.,0
And so Bertie went to the storeroom and found a cricket bat.,0
"On his return, he climbed up onto his bunk bed with the bat and let it be known that if anyone came near him in the night, they would receive a Six. Although none of the boys played cricket they understood that a Six with a cricket bat would probably hurt quite a lot, and they forgot their plan to tie him to the bed and went to sleep.",0
"The following morning in the dining hall, as the newcomers to the boot camp tried to eat the world’s lumpiest porridge and the coldest, hardest toast, Boris spotted his fellow prince and called out,",0
"Hey Bertie. I hear you didn’t sleep much last night."" There was general laughter all around the hall because the story of Bertie and the cricket bat had already got around.",0
"It was true, he hadn’t been able to sleep much, as he was on the lookout for attackers all night long.",0
"Over the following two weeks they tried all sorts of new activities such as a canoeing expedition on Loch Gorm, during which Bertie capsized dozens of times and was soaked through for two whole days;",0
"climbing, in which Bertie found that he could cling to the tiniest of pimples on the rock face of a mountain, and somehow scramble up an impossible cliff with a looping overhang at the top, abseiling down a rope from a terrifying height, endless hikes up mountains through the drizzle and mist, during which Bertie somehow managed to appreciate the beauty of Scotland. He thought it quite remarkable that if you arrange rocks, thistles, mists and gushing streams in just the right fashion, they become stunningly attractive to the eye.",0
"It was just a pity about the rain and the biting attacks by flying insects, which the Scottish lads called, ",0
wee beasties.,1
But a greater torment than the,0
"wee beasties,",1
"were the boys from Hamburg and Glasgow, who still made it clear that they didn’t think much of princes whose fathers paid for them to go to all-inclusive boot camps.",0
"He shared his supply of chocolate, which softened their attitude a little bit.",0
"He stood up to Hans, who threatened to punch him, and then backed off.",0
That won him a little respect.,0
But as they approached the end of the boot camp.,0
Bertie had still not made any friends.,0
He didn’t feel miserable.,0
Two weeks of wet and cold had made him indifferent to almost everything.,0
Captain Tim wondered if he had given Bertie a hard enough time to satisfy the wicked queen.,0
"He concluded,",0
Probably not.,1
He’s not cracked a bit.,1
The young prince has had it way too easy.,1
"So, for the grand finale to the boot camp he thought up a new activity that he was certain would sort Bertie out.",0
"It was a game of hide-and-seek, only with a few original twists.",0
Boris led a group of seekers.,0
Bertie led a group of hiders.,0
The major borrowed a pack of hunting dogs.,0
Right now Boris. Here’s something I pinched from the laundry that will help the dogs get the scent.,1
And he handed him a pair of royal blue Y-fronts with a royal crest embroidered on the hem.,0
They could only have belonged to Prince Bertie.,0
"Why thanks Major Tim,",1
"said Boris. ""Oh, and when you catch anyone, chuck ‘em in the coal-hole for the night.""",0
"Right oh,",1
said Boris. The coal hole was a cavern beneath the school.,0
"It would make an excellent dungeon – cold, damp, dirty, and pitch black.",0
It was said to be haunted by the ghosts of boys who had died while at the boarding school.,0
"Major Tim thought to himself,",0
"Well if Bertie doesn’t go back to the wicked queen crying that he had the worst time of his life, then my name’s Florence Nightingale.",1
"As darkness fell, Bertie’s group split up and ran into the woods.",0
Billy ran into the barn and hid in some haystacks.,0
Hans found a cave in some rocks.,0
"The others dug holes in the ground and covered themselves with leaves, or built shelters and disguised them with bushes.",0
Bertie ran as far as he could.,0
"When he heard the sound of barking he thought,",0
Oh-oh.,1
They’ve set the hounds on us.,1
That’s not playing fair.,1
He started to splash along a stream to put them off the scent.,0
"He thought of running across the road and hiding in the next-door farm, but that was out of bounds.",0
Then he had a better idea:,0
He saw a branch of a tree that was overhanging the stream.,0
He pulled himself up onto it and started to climb upwards.,0
He went higher and higher until he was lost among the canopies.,0
The dogs were all over the woods and the others were being unearthed like so many rabbits.,0
"He heard Boris shout,",0
Bertie I can see you.,1
Come out with your hands up.,1
He knew it was just a bluff because Boris was also cursing the dogs for not finding Bertie’s scent.,0
"When he had rounded up all eleven of the other group and taken them off to the coal hole, he came back again for Bertie. It was getting on for midnight.",0
"Bertie was growing tired clinging to a branch high up in his tree, but he listened with satisfaction as Boris led the dogs across the road and into the next-door farm.",0
"When the hunters finally gave up and went back home, Bertie climbed down from his tree.",0
"He was tempted to go back to bed by himself, but then he thought of the others lying in the dark coal-hole.",0
"He didn’t care for them much, and he thought it might serve them right.",0
Then he felt a sense of injustice rising up inside him.,0
"Nobody deserves to be treated like that,",1
he thought.,0
"And so he sneaked past the sleeping sentry, unbolted the coal hole, and released the prisoners.",0
They came out covered in dirt and spluttering with coal dust.,0
"The sentry, who was the daughter of a TV weather man, awoke, but she was frightened by the dark figures emerging out of the coal hole, and she pretended to be still asleep.",0
They all ran back to the showers and spent the night tucked up in bed.,0
"In the morning, an angry farmer called to say that a pack of dogs had been running through his crops.",0
"Major Tim was not pleased with Boris. As for Bertie, need I say that he was a bit of a hero?",0
"Even Hans shook his hand and apologised for calling him Prince Scum. Billy patted him on the back and said,",0
"Now I ken you’re a great lad, even if you are a prince.",1
"Bertie invited them all to come and stay at the palace for Christmas. He knew that the wicked queen would hardly be pleased, but he didn’t really care about that.",0
"He danced with the prettiest girl at the end of the camp jig – but of course, he didn’t forget the lovely Princess Beatrice. Major Tim wrote to the Wicked Queen saying, ",0
"I gave him my worst, but Prince Bertie is a tough nut and a hard case, and if he ever wants a job in the marines, I’d be glad to recommend him.",0
"The Christmas Cherry Tree My Lords and Ladies, you shall hear of one who lived many generations ago, in the time of King Uther Pendragon, father of the famed King Arthur. I speak of a knight, hardy and strong, tall and fair, brave and noble.",0
"In all the world there lived no one as courteous, noble or generous as he.",0
"To landowners, who struggled in times of war, he gave gold.",0
"To poor farmers who rented lands from him, he gave food and good cheer.",0
A spare place at his table was always laid just in case anyone might pay a visit to him.,0
"This knight had a gentle wife, the best a man could wish for.",0
"No woman was more beautiful, or more noble in her heart than she.",0
Dame Clarys was her name.,0
"Of goodness, she had truly.",0
Together they brought gladness to many a soul.,0
"No man, rich or poor, felt any ill will against them.",0
"Every year, Sir Cleges, for that was the name of this noble knight, would hold a feast at Christmas time.",0
No king celebrated that day in greater style than he.,0
Rich and poor came to his feast.,0
He would turn away no man.,0
"Friars payed him with blessings, minstrels with music – those were the highest prices he would ask for his food.",0
"When the feasting was over, the guests would not leave without gifts.",0
"He gave freely of robes, horses, silver and even gold.",0
All this he did in honour of Him who was born in a manger on that day.,0
But his wealth dwindled with each passing year.,0
He would not give up his feasting or his gifts.,0
"He let, mortgaged, even sold his lands to pay for his generosity, until at last he had almost nothing left.",0
The Christmas feasting had to end.,0
"He lived meekly with his good wife and two children – and of luxuries, they knew no more.",0
"One Christmas Eve, Sir Cleges was walking up and down his garden, when he heard the sound of trumpets, pipes, drums, harps and cymbals.",0
He could hear carols and dancing.,0
The sound of merriment brought back memories of his past feasts and festivities.,0
"He knew well that the music came from the court of King Uther, who was at Cardiff for Christmas. The King had not invited his loyal knight to join his table for the festivities.",0
"He had either forgotten him, or thought that he was dead.",0
Sir Cleges wrung his hands began to pray piteously.,0
"Oh Jesus, heavenly king, you made everything out of nothing.",1
"I thank you for times past, for the merriment I used to make.",1
I gave freely for your sake.,1
I fed both rich and poor.,1
"Those who dined at my table did not lack for any meat or game, or good drinks.",1
Of the cost I thought nothing.,1
"Now, here I stand, a poor man at your service, overlooked and forgotten by all mortal men, high and low.",1
"As he stood mourning so, his wife came to him, and enfolded him in her arms.",0
"She kissed him with glad heart and said, ""My true husband, I heard what you were saying.",0
"It does not help to have sad thoughts, so let your sorrow be gone.",0
"Everyone should be happy on this day, and be glad with what they have got.",0
"So let us go inside, and be merry and eat our dinner joyfully.""",0
"Of course,",1
said Sir Cleges. With somewhat better cheer he quickly wiped the tear from his cheek and went inside to eat his food.,0
"After they had eaten, they took great delight in playing with their two children.",0
At midnight they went to church and asked God to keep them clothed and fed.,0
"On Christmas morning, Sir Cleges went into his garden.",0
"He kneeled on the snow covered ground before his favourite cherry tree, and prayed once again.",0
"When he had finished, he reached up for a branch to help him stand.",0
"As he arose, the bough broke in his hand.",0
"He noticed that it bore green leaves, and that there were ripe, round cherries clustered around it.",0
"He said,",0
Dear God. What manner of berries are these that grow at this time of year?,0
Then he picked a cherry and tried it.,0
It was the most delicious fruit he had tasted since he was a small boy.,0
He cut off a little branch and took it to his wife to show her.,0
"My dear, here is a novelty,",1
he said.,0
"""I found these growing in our garden.",0
Cherries in mid winter.,0
"I am afraid it is some ill omen, a warning to me for my sorrow and grieving.""",0
"Why no,",1
"said his wife, ""Rather it is a sign that goodness is coming to us.",0
"Tomorrow at first light, take the cherries to Cardiff and the King. He will have no better gift than this."" When it was daylight, she prepared a large basket full of cherries.",0
"She told their eldest son to carry it on his back, and walk behind his father to Cardiff. So they set off, not on a steed or pony, but Sir Cleges’ walking stick as his only support.",0
"When they arrived at the gates of the castle, the porter saw his poor clothing and said,",0
"You shall turn around and leave smartly without delay, or by God and St. Mary, I shall break your head.",1
Go and stand in the beggars’ row.,1
That’s the place for you.,1
"But Sir Cleges said,",0
Good Sir. I pray you let me go in.,1
I have a present for the king.,1
"Here, look.",1
The porter went over to the basket and lifted the lid.,0
"When he saw the cherries he marvelled and said,",0
"If I let you pass, you must promise me a third of whatever reward the king shall grant you for this gift, be it silver or gold.",1
"Sir Cleges replied,",0
"I consent,"" and he went through the gate into the castle.",0
"On his way to the banqueting hall he met an usher of the court who said, ",0
"Go, vassal, get out of my sight, and if I find you again within these walls I shall beat your head and your limbs without a moment’s regret.",1
"At this, Sir Cleges said,",0
Good Sir. Stay your anger.,1
Be gentle and good - for I have brought a present for the king.,1
"See here, these fruits grew this Christmas season in my garden.",1
They are the fairest cherries that man did ever see.,1
"When the usher saw the cherries, he was amazed and said,",0
"If you grant me a third part of whatever you may win for these, then you may indeed go on.",1
"As Sir Cleges had no other choice, he agreed to the usher’s terms, and into the hall he went with his son and the basket.",0
"As they entered the Hall, the steward saw them.",0
"He went up to Sir Cleges and said,",0
Who made you so bold as to come in here uninvited?,1
Turn around smartly and get out.,1
"Sir Cleges replied,",0
"See, good sir, I have a gift for the king.",1
"When the steward saw what he had brought he exclaimed,",0
By Mary I never saw such fruits at this time of year.,1
"You shall go before the king, but only if you promise me a third part of whatever you shall receive.",1
"Sir Cleges stood and thought to himself that betwixt these three men, he would divide all that he received.",0
For all his trouble he would win nothing.,0
"As he did not reply right away, the steward demanded,",0
Have you no tongue?,1
Give me your answer without delay or I shall beat your rags with my stick!,1
"Seeing that he had no other choice, Sir Cleges said,",0
"Very well, whatever the king shall reward, you shall have a third part.",1
"The steward brought Sir Cleges before the king, where he knelt down and uncovered the basket.",0
"Great King,",1
he said.,0
"""These fruits grew in my garden this christmas time, and I have brought them to you as a gift."" The king saw the cherries, fresh and new, and said,",0
Truly this is the work of our Lord.,1
He commanded Sir Cleges to sit down and join the feast.,0
"The king sent a portion of the cherries to a radiant and fair lady in Cornwall, and he commanded the rest to be served around the hall.",0
"When all had eaten and were glad, the king commanded,",0
Bring before me the poor man who gave me the cherries.,1
"Sir Cleges knelt again before the king, and the kind said,",0
I thank you heartily for the gift you have brought me.,1
It has honoured my feast.,1
"Whatever you will have, I will grant you.",1
"Whatever your heart desires, be it lands, or serfs or goods.",1
"Sir Cleges replied,",0
Great King. I ask nothing but twelve strokes of my stick that I might give freely to my enemies around this castle.,1
"On hearing this the king was angry and said,",0
I am sorry that I granted you this gift.,1
"Better that you asked for silver or gold, for you have more need of it.",1
"Nevertheless, if that is your wish, let my debt to you be paid with blows.",1
Sir Cleges went into the hall and sought the steward to give him his reward.,0
He dealt him such a blow that it knocked him down.,0
Then he gave him three more.,0
"On leaving the hall he found the usher and told him,",0
Here’s the third part of my gift that I promised you!,1
And he beat him four times with his stick.,0
Then he found the porter and gave him his reward with the words.,0
I keep my bargain.,1
"Take this, and this, and this and this!",1
"While Sir Cleges was busy paying back his enemies, the king sat in his chamber and listened to a minstrel.",0
"The minstrel sang of a great knight who had served him in years past, one who was full of fortune, nobility and grace.",0
"His name was Sir Cleges. As the king listened, memories came back to him, and he realised that he had seen the good knight that very evening.",0
"Sire, indeed it was,",1
replied the minstrel.,0
"When word reached the lords and ladies of the court of how Sir Cleges had paid back the porter, the usher and the steward, they all laughed heartily and thought that it was good sport.",0
"The king called Sir Cleges before him, and this time he gave him lands, forests, and a cup of gold to take to his wife.",0
He made his son a squire and gave him fine clothes to wear.,0
"Every year after that, Sir Cleges and his wife celebrated Christmas with good food, music, merriment and gifts, and they lived in great happiness until the Good Lord sent for them.",0
Sit back and enjoy this longish story with sound effects.,0
"The music is the Dance of the Hours by Ponchielli. The story I am going to tell you happened a great many years ago in China, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten.",0
The emperor’s palace was the most beautiful in the world.,0
"It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful.",0
"In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed could not help noticing the flowers.",0
"Indeed, everything in the emperor’s garden was remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended.",0
"Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest, with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great ships sailed under the shadow of its branches.",0
"In one of these trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so many other things to do, would stop and listen.",0
"Sometimes, when they went at night to spread their nets, they would hear her sing, and say,",0
"Oh, is not that beautiful?",1
"But when they returned to their fishing, they forgot the bird until the next night.",0
"Then they would hear it again, and exclaim,",0
"Oh, how beautiful is the nightingale’s song!",1
"Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of the emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the palace and gardens;",0
"but when they heard the nightingale, they all declared it to be the best of all.",0
"And the travellers, on their return home, related what they had seen;",0
"and learned men wrote books, containing descriptions of the town, the palace, and the gardens;",0
"but they did not forget the nightingale, which was really the greatest wonder.",0
"And those who could write poetry composed beautiful verses about the nightingale, who lived in a forest near the deep sea.",0
"The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor;",0
"and he sat in his golden chair, and as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.",0
"But when he came to the words,",0
"the nightingale is the most beautiful of all,",1
"he exclaimed,",0
What is this?,1
I know nothing of any nightingale.,1
Is there such a bird in my empire?,1
Even in my garden?,1
I have never heard of it.,1
"Something, it appears, may be learnt from books.",1
"Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer,",0
"Pooh,",1
which means nothing.,0
"There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here, called a nightingale,",1
"said the emperor,",0
they say it is the best thing in my large kingdom.,1
Why have I not been told of it?,1
"I have never heard the name,",1
"replied the cavalier,",0
she has not been presented at court.,1
"It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening,",1
said the emperor.,0
The whole world knows what I possess better than I do myself.,1
"I have never heard of her,",1
"said the cavalier,",0
yet I will endeavour to find her.,1
But where was the nightingale to be found?,0
"The nobleman went upstairs and down, through halls and passages;",0
yet none of those whom he met had heard of the bird.,0
"So he returned to the emperor, and said that it must be a fable, invented by those who had written the book.",0
"Your Imperial Majesty,",1
"said he,",0
cannot believe everything contained in books;,1
"sometimes they are only fiction, or what is called the black art.",1
"But the book in which I have read this account,",1
"said the emperor,",0
"was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood.",1
"I will hear the nightingale, she must be here this evening;",1
"she has my highest favour and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended.",1
Tsing-pe!,1
"Cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he ran up and downstairs, through all the halls and corridors;",0
"and half the court ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon.",0
"There was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom all the world knew, but who was unknown to the court.",0
"At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said,",0
"Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well;",1
"indeed, she can sing.",1
Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table;,1
"she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale’s song.",1
"Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.",1
"Little maiden,",1
"said the lord-in-waiting,",0
"I will obtain for you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the nightingale;",1
for she is invited for this evening to the palace.,1
"So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the court followed her.",0
"As they went along, a cow began lowing.",0
"said a young courtier,",0
now we have found her!,1
What wonderful power for such a small creature;,1
I have certainly heard it before.,1
"No, that is only a cow lowing,",1
"said the little girl,",0
we are a long way from the place yet.,1
Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.,0
"Beautiful,",1
said the young courtier again.,0
"Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells.",1
"No, those are frogs,",1
"said the little maiden,",0
"but I think we shall soon hear her now,",1
and presently the nightingale began to sing.,0
"Hark, hark!",1
"There she is,",1
"said the girl,",0
"and there she sits,",1
"she added, pointing to a little grey bird who was perched on a bough.",0
Is it possible?,1
Said the lord-in-waiting.,0
"I never imagined it would be a little, plain, simple thing like that.",1
She has certainly changed colour at seeing so many grand people around her.,1
"Little nightingale,",1
"cried the girl, raising her voice,",0
our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him.,1
"With the greatest pleasure,",1
"said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.",0
"It sounds like tiny glass bells,",1
"said the lord-in-waiting,",0
and see how her little throat works.,1
It is surprising that we have never heard this before;,1
she will be a great success at court.,1
Shall I sing once more before the emperor?,1
"Asked the nightingale, who thought he was present.",0
"My excellent little nightingale,",1
"said the courtier,",0
"I have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening, where you will gain imperial favour by your charming song.",1
"My song sounds best in the green wood,",1
said the bird;,0
but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor’s wish.,0
The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion.,0
The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.,0
"Beautiful flowers, around which little bells were tied, stood in the corridors - what with the running to and fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.",0
"In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the nightingale to sit on.",0
"The whole court was present, and the little kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door.",0
She was not installed as a real court cook.,0
"All were in full dress, and every eye was turned to the little grey bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin.",0
"The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor’s eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks as her song became still more touching and went to every one’s heart.",0
"The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honour with thanks as she had been sufficiently rewarded already.",0
"I have seen tears in an emperor’s eyes,",1
"she said,",0
that is my richest reward.,1
"An emperor’s tears have wonderful power, and are quite sufficient honour for me,",1
and then she sang again more enchantingly than ever.,0
"That singing is a lovely gift,",1
"said the ladies of the court to each other, and then they took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to anyone, so that they might fancy themselves nightingales.",0
"The footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please.",0
In fact the nightingale’s visit was most successful.,0
"She was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, and once during the night.",0
"Twelve servants were appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken string fastened to her leg.",0
There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying.,0
"The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people met, one said",0
"nightin,",1
and the other said,0
"gale,",1
"and they understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of.",0
"Eleven peddlers’ children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note.",0
"One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written,",0
The Nightingale.,1
"Here is no doubt a new book about our celebrated bird,",1
said the emperor.,0
"But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.",0
"As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold.",0
"Around its neck hung a piece of ribbon, on which was written",0
The Emperor of China’s nightingale is poor compared with that of the Emperor of Japan’s.,1
"This is very beautiful,",1
"exclaimed all who saw it, and he who had brought the artificial bird received the title of",0
Imperial nightingale-bringer-in-chief.,1
"Now they must sing together,",1
"said the court,",0
and what a duet it will be.,1
"But they did not get on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes.",0
"That is not a fault,",1
"said the music master,",0
"it is quite perfect to my taste,",1
"so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird;",0
"besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast pins.",0
Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired;,0
"the people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something.",0
But where was she?,0
"No one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods.",0
"What strange conduct,",1
"said the emperor, when her flight had been discovered;",0
"and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was a very ungrateful creature.",0
"But we have the best bird after all,",1
"said one, and then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult.",0
"But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale;",0
"not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power.",0
"For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled.",1
"It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another.",1
"This is exactly what we think,",1
"they all replied, and then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing.",0
When they heard it they were like people intoxicated;,0
"however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom.",0
"They all said,",0
"and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said,",0
"It sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike;",1
"yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what.",1
"After this the real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperor’s bed.",0
"The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of",0
"Little Imperial Toilet Singer,",1
and to the rank of No. one on the left hand;,0
"for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.",0
"The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full of the most difficult Chinese words;",0
"yet all the people said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies trampled upon.",0
"So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese persons knew every little turn in the artificial bird’s song;",0
and for that same reason it pleased them better.,0
"They could sing with the bird, which they often did.",0
"The street-boys sang,",0
"Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck,",1
and the emperor himself could sing it also.,0
It was really most amusing.,0
"One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird sounded",0
whizz.,1
Then a spring cracked.,0
Whir-r-r-r,1
"went all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped.",0
"The emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician;",0
but what could he do?,0
Then they sent for a watchmaker;,0
"and after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like order, but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music.",0
"Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year;",0
and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.,0
"Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever - and of course no one contradicted him.",0
"Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land.",0
"The Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live.",0
"Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was, but he only said,",0
Pooh!,1
and shook his head.,0
Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed.,0
"The whole court thought he was dead, and everyone ran away to pay homage to his successor.",0
"The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and the ladies’ maids invited company to take coffee.",0
"Cloth had been laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep should be heard, and all was silent and still.",0
"But the emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels.",0
"A window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird.",0
"The poor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange weight on his chest, opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there.",0
"He had put on the emperor’s golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.",0
"All around the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking.",0
"These were the emperor’s good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.",0
Do you remember this?,1
Do you recollect that?,1
"They asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow.",0
"I know nothing about it,",1
said the emperor.,0
Music!,1
Music!,1
He cried.,0
The large Chinese drum!,1
That I may not hear what they say.,1
"But they still went on, and Death nodded like a China-man to all they said.",0
Music!,1
Music!,1
Shouted the emperor.,0
"You little precious golden bird, sing, pray sing!",1
I have given you gold and costly presents;,1
I have even hung my golden slipper around your neck.,1
Sing!,1
Sing!,1
But the bird remained silent.,0
"There was no one to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note.",0
"Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still.",0
Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music.,0
"Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale.",0
"She had heard of the emperor’s illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.",0
"As she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler;",0
"the blood in the emperor’s veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs.",0
"Even Death himself listened, and said,",0
"Go on, little nightingale, go on.",1
Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that rich banner?,1
Will you give me the emperor’s crown?,1
Said the bird.,0
So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song;,0
and the nightingale continued her singing.,0
"She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners’ tears.",0
"Then Death longed to go and see his garden, and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.",0
"Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird.",1
I know you well.,1
"I banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart with your sweet song.",1
How can I reward you?,1
"You have already rewarded me,",1
said the nightingale.,0
I shall never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang to you.,1
These are the jewels that rejoice a singer’s heart.,1
"But now sleep, and grow strong and well again.",1
I will sing to you again.,1
"As she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep;",0
and how mild and refreshing that slumber was!,0
"When he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window, but not one of his servants had returned — they all believed he was dead;",0
"only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang.",0
"You must always remain with me,",1
said the emperor.,0
"You shall sing only when it pleases you, and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces.",1
"Do not do that,",1
"replied the nightingale,",0
the bird did very well as long as it could.,1
Keep it here still.,1
I cannot live in the palace and build my nest;,1
but let me come when I like.,1
"I will sit on a bough outside your window in the evening and sing to you, so that you may be happy and have thoughts full of joy.",1
"I will sing to you of those who are happy, and those who suffer;",1
of the good and the evil who are hidden around you.,1
The little singing bird flies far from you and your court to the home of the fisherman and the peasant’s cot.,1
I love your heart better than your crown;,1
and yet something holy lingers around that also.,1
"I will come, I will sing to you;",1
but you must promise me one thing.,1
"Everything,",1
"said the emperor, who having dressed himself in his imperial robes, stood with the hand that held the heavy golden sword pressed to his heart.",0
"I only ask one thing,",1
"she replied,",0
let no one know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.,1
It will be best to conceal it.,1
"So saying, the nightingale flew away.",0
Dedicated to Maya and Liam Part One is here.,0
"Only fish, fools, and crocodiles swim in the river Nile. Well I have seen dogs dip in the blue swirly waters, but they count as fools.",0
"We cats, we are land loving creatures.",0
"Neither I nor my sister friend, Cleo, have the slightest desire to entrust our lives to a leaky boat.",0
"Sober is the god of the Nile, and his head is a crocodile.",0
That tells you all you need to know about the river.,0
"If you dip so much as a paw into its waters, Sober or one of his sacred crocs might bite hold of it!",0
"I have seen boats glide down the shimmering band of blue, carrying all sorts of cargoes, barley flour, salt, spices, but mainly people, soldiers, slaves, merchants...",0
"I’ve seen a boat so overloaded with pilgrims, dancing, waving and partying, that it turned over and tipped them all into the water.",0
I’ve always thought:,0
No way will you ever catch a smart cat like me on board one of those floating death traps.,1
"So now, you ask me, how is it that I am hanging my head over the edge of one of those wooden boats and belching up into the Sacred Waters?",0
"And how come that Cleo, who shares my views on the perils of wetness is here with me?",0
"Here’s why If you heard my previous story, you will know that our master,Amon the Priest, was locked up in Jail. He was wrongly accused of stealing a gold statue of our glorious cat goddess, Lady Bastet. Lady Bastet herself told us that the high priest, Simon the Greek was the guilty party who had pilfered the statue and that his plan was to sell it to pirates.",0
Simon is ahead of us.,0
"He has taken the statue up river to the city of Naucratis, up in the river delta where fingers of the Nile reach out into the sea and the lush crops grow all around where the waters flood.",0
"We have to prove that Amon is innocent, or we are done for.Nobody else will look after us the way he does.",0
"Without his protection, we will be a couple of stray kitties hanging amongst thousands skinny, scraggy, fleabitten mogs.",0
We’ll be scrounging through rubbish heaps and hanging around pilgrims me-owing for scraps.,0
We’ll be lucky if we dine on one mouse a week!,0
So that’s why are suffering from travel sickness !,0
Finally!,0
Lady Bastet be praised!,0
We two kitties have made it safely onto dry land.,0
Here we are at the port of Naucratis. You could hardly know that we are still in Egypt.The humans here are speaking a strange language.,0
It is all Greek to me !,0
This is a Greek city and trading port inside Egypt. Our Pharaoh lets the Greeks live here because it’s profitable to sell them things.,0
Oh my!,0
What a busy place !,0
Meehow !,0
That cart nearly ran over my tail!,0
So many people !,0
"This way and that they go, carrying things on and off the ships, selling things, arguing over things, fighting over things, or just hanging around.",0
We must make a dash for somewhere quiet before somebody treads on us.,0
Let’s head for that doorway Cleo !,0
All day we sloped around the port.,0
"They trade all sorts here - cargoes of flour, large watermelons, fabrics, clothes, swords, helmets, trinkets, but we are yet to see any sacred statues.",0
We spoke to a ship’s cat from the island of Samos. He’s a rough looking fellow - half his ear was bitten off in a fight.,0
"He was helpful, but I didn’t like the way he eyed my gold earring.",0
He told us that it is illegal to sell sacred statues.,0
"said Cleo,",0
we might as well go home.,1
They won’t be selling sacred statues round here.,1
The sly old ship’s cat scratched his half-ear.,0
"I don’t say it don’t go on,",1
"he told us,",0
Lots of things go on here that aren’t supposed to.,1
You mean stuff that’s against the law?,1
asked Cleo.,0
"You said it, kitty-face, not me!",1
he meowed.,0
"Now if you know anything about bad stuff, you’ll understand that a lot of it goes on at night.The humans don’t see well in the dark, and they think that their evil deeds won’t be spotted by people.",0
"As for us cats, our eyes can spot a mouse in the shadows, so we like the night, but we also get into fights in the dark.",0
"The dark is kind of thrilling to us, but also dangerous.",0
Cleo and I crouched and watched the ships.,0
"We swished our tails when we saw a ship’s rat scurrying down a gangplank, but we had to hold ourselves back from pouncing.",0
It’s probably for the best.,0
He was a tough rodent who would have fought back tooth and claw.,0
We were waiting to catch a bigger mouse.,0
Our prize was none other than the gold statue of Lady Bastet. All night we waited.,0
We saw suspicious characters come and go.,0
"We heard music, laughter, and fights.",0
"A knife glinted in the moonlight, and a sailor had to hand over his gold coin to a couple of robbers.",0
A ship’s captain shouted at his crew because they had eaten all food when he returned home from a night on the town.,0
"We hid from a pack of wild dogs, and we chatted with the cats who creep around the docks where they unload the fish.",0
We even spoke to the sea gulls.,0
"But noone had any intel on Simon the Greek, the thief priest from our temple, nor of the statue of lady Bastet. It was almost morning when we chatting with a greek cat called Zelina.",0
"Cheer up,",1
"she meowed,",0
Apollo is rising above the city.,1
"That means the fishing boats will soon be back,",1
Who is Apollo?,1
Cleo asked.,0
"Why, everyone knows he is the Sun God who heralds the day.",1
"Oh, you mean Ra,",1
I said.,0
"These Greeks have got their gods all mixed up, but with a little comparing you can work out who they are talking about.",0
"And then, just as an afterthought, I said :",0
What do you Greeks call your cat goddess?,1
"Well as it happens,",1
"said Zelina,",0
We Greeks are lacking a cat goddess.,1
Cats are unknown on mount Olympus.,1
Really?,1
said Cleo.,0
That’s so uncivilised.,1
Shocking!,1
"You are surely right, ",0
" said Zelina, ",0
 But fortunately change is afoot.,1
"Our ship’s captain has his eye on a beautiful statue of the Egyptian Cat Goddess. He plans to take her back to Greece. I can’t wait to see the look on the stupid dogs’ faces when they see our master bow down to a cat goddess before he fries a fat juicy fish for her breakfast, which we shipshape cats shall share in, of course.",1
"Of course,",1
we agreed.,0
"But deerest Zelina, do tell us, where is this cat goddess you mention?",1
She pointed with her paw down a long avenue.,0
"We thanked Zelina and scampered straight off,",0
"Hey, aren’t you waiting for the fishing boats?",1
she called after us.,0
But we were in a hurry.,0
Where are we going?,1
"Asked Cleo, as we ran.",0
"To Simon the Greek and the statue,",1
I meowed.,0
But where is he?,1
Down this road somewhere.,1
"On, on we went, down the avenue.",0
It was mostly deserted.,0
"A few traders were setting up their stalls by the side of the road, ready to sell baked bananas and fried sheep eyes to the early risers.",0
But where would Simon the Greek be hanging out?,0
By now we were slowing down.,0
We had pounded the road so hard that our paws were smarting.,0
Which of these many buildings was Simon the Greek staying in?,0
We had forgotten to ask.,0
"Thankfully, the goddess sent us a clue:",0
something we were sure to notice :,0
the smell of grilled sardines.,0
"MMMMM Then we saw that one of the buildings was a small temple, more of a shrine you might say.",0
The feet of its twin gate posts were cats’ paws.,0
This had to be the place.,0
"This had to be a shrine dedicated to our Lady Bastet. We crept inside the courtyard, and sure enough, there we found him :",0
Simon the Greek was cooking his breakfast.,0
The aroma was delicious.,0
"Normally we would have purred and rubbed ourselves around his legs until he either gave us a few titbits of fish or more likely told us to scram before he had us skinned, grilled, or sold us as kebabs But this was no time to think of our stomachs.",0
This was our one and only chance to save our master Amon and many future dinners given to us on plates.,0
Cleo hid behind the bronze gong.,0
I placed myself behind the statue of Bastet. It was only a small stone statue mind you - not a patch on the gold and jewel encrusted statue stolen from our temple.,0
"Simon,",1
"I hissed, using a little magic to sound like the voice of the goddess.",0
"Simon,",1
"repeated Cleo, like a ghostly echo.",0
That got his attention.,0
"He is high priest to the cat goddess and he understands our cat language, as well a Greek and Egyptian. But he could not see us.",0
He glanced over at the altar.,0
It seems he believed that the goddess was addressing him.,0
How did you think you could escape?,1
I went on.,0
"Did you think that you could fool me, Lady Bastet. My blue eyes see through the dark.",1
I am a witness to your thieving.,1
SSSSSSSSS!,1
"Hissed Cleo supportively, out of sight.",0
"How I wished that I could see his expression, to judge if he was falling for our trick !",0
But I had to remain hidden.,0
I stayed silent for a few moments to let my words sink in.,0
"Then, gratifyingly, I heard him start to pray:",0
"Oh Glorious lady of the Cat Whiskers, you of the golden paws, the lapis blue eyes, the pointed nose, the rough tongue, and the elegant legs that move stealthily through the night.",1
"Here I am, Simon the Greek, your high priest, your humble servant.",1
Your wish is my command.,1
This was fantastic.,0
I’ve always wanted a man to speak to me like that.,0
"If only I had been born a goddess, and could command this type of respect all the time.",0
Listen up!,1
"I said,",0
"You’ve been a bad, bad boy.",1
You’ve stolen my statue.,1
I’m not pleased.,1
Take it back immediately to the temple at Bakst. Don’t you dare sell it to greek pirates.,1
"Make sure the police know that it is returned to its rightful place, and that they let Amon the Priest out of jail, for he is entirely innocent.",1
"And while you are about it, give a special reward to his two cats, because they have remained faithful to him, and to me, all through these trials and tribulations.",1
Simon the Greek bowed so deeply that I could hear his forehead hitting against the stone paw of the statue.,0
That was gratifying.,0
"Still bowing he backed away from the alter, thanking the goddess for great mercy, and vowing to return the stolen effigy.",0
"He was soon out of that shrine, and I’m glad to say he forgot to eat his breakfast, a task which we completed for him, soon enough.",0
"I think you may rest assured that by next time I speak to you, all will be back to normal, and we shall be living once again with our master, Amon the Priest, newly restored from Jail, and we can look forward to lots of nice rewards.",0
"Katie and the Invisible Umbrella Hello, this is Natasha, and I’m here with a story about Katie, who is an ordinary girl, but there is just one thing that is rather unusual about her.",0
She’s a witch and she can do magic tricks.,0
"Katie’s Grandmother had all sorts of beautiful, but rather old fashioned, magical things.",0
"Many of them weren’t so useful these days, because science has caught up with magic in so many ways.",0
"For instance, before electric kettles were invented, witches had magic cauldrons that boiled the water without any need to put them on the fire.",0
"Well, Katie’s Grandma still used one of those to make her tea and coffee.",0
"And before phones were invented, witches used to call one another using crystal balls, and Katie’s Grandma absolutely refused to get a mobile phone or a computer, so if you wanted to send her a text message, you had to use a crystal ball.",0
"And of course she still kept a witch’s broomstick, though of course these days most witches prefer to drive a car or take the bus, because broomsticks are not very comfortable.",0
But one of Grandma’s most beautiful possessions was her umbrella.,0
It had a golden handle that was shaped like a head of a griffin.,0
"The fabric was decorated with old fashioned magic symbols, which Katie could not understand, because these days most witches learn to do spells in modern languages like English or French. But they were very beautiful and Katie loved looking at them.",0
"Oi, you could say ‘sorry’, or ‘excuse me!’",1
exclaimed Katie. The man turned around and stared at her blankly like she wasn’t there.,0
"Katie continued home, but it wasn’t long before she collided with a traffic warden and then was nearly run over by a woman with a pram.",0
Aren’t people rude these days?,1
thought Katie.,0
It’s just a little bit of rain.,1
"They are all in such a hurry, you would think they were all running away from a rampaging elephant or something.",1
"As she stepped through the door of the house, she half closed the umbrella, meaning to leave it in the hallway to dry off.",0
And that was when she noticed something very peculiar about it.,0
"Because, until the umbrella snapped shut, she couldn’t see it.",0
"And then, when it went",0
"click,",1
it appeared again.,0
"The next morning promised a bright and sunny day – but all the same, Katie took her umbrella with her to school.",0
"At break-time, Katie’s friends, Jenny and Isis, were talking about their favourite tv programme.",0
"It was one of those talent contests which are so popular these days, and they were discussing who was going to win.",0
Suddenly they could hear Katie saying:,0
"I think it will be Annabelle McTabith, because although she’s not beautiful like most stars, she’s got an amazing singing voice.",1
"Next, Katie did something she had always wanted to do.",0
"She went into the Teachers’ Staff Room. She saw Miss Vile and Mr Phillpott sitting very cosily together, and she heard Mrs Jefferson saying,",0
"That boy Darcy Thomas has so many airs and graces that you would think he was royalty,",1
"and Miss Thomas was nodding and saying,",0
"Well you should see the parents, they’re so stuck-up that on parents day I felt I ought to curtsy to them.",1
"Katie snickered because Darcy really did fancy himself rather too much, and then she remembered that she had to keep quiet.",0
The bell rang for lessons and Mr. Hutchinson said:,0
"Oh no, I don’t think I can face the hooligans of Class fourC.",1
Katie hurried back to her class room.,0
She sat down next to Isis and held the umbrella over both of them so that they were invisible together.,0
"Miss Vile came in, and the babble of children’s voices died down.",0
The teacher cast her steely gaze over the room and noted the empty seats where Katie and Isis normally sat.,0
"When she turned her back, Katie let down the umbrella.",0
There were gasps from those who saw the two friends appear.,0
Miss Vile span around and stared at them.,0
"Katie put on her most innocent face, and Isis didn’t have to put on a face because she really was innocent.",0
Miss Vile said:,0
"Katie, there’s no need to bring that umbrella into the classroom.",1
It’s got a sharp point on the end and it’s against Health and Safety.,1
"And at the end of the lesson, when Katie asked for her umbrella back, Miss Vile said:",0
It’s confiscated Katie. You can ask me for it at the end of term.,1
"It was supposed to be a secret that Katie was a witch, but of course Miss Vile had seen more than a few odd things happen during her time teaching her, and she had her suspicions.",0
"Her instinct told her that there was something pretty unusual about the umbrella, and of course, she was right.",0
"Suddenly it seemed like Miss Vile was everywhere, all at once.",0
Some boys who were kicking bags around the cloakroom didn’t notice that Miss Vile was watching them.,0
"In class fourC, when Mr. Hutchinson’s back was turned, the",0
hooligans,1
started chatting to each other.,0
Somehow they didn’t see that Miss Vile was in the room and noting down their names.,0
"When Isis and Katie were trying out lipstick in the girl’s loos, they didn’t realise that Miss Vile was standing behind them.",0
Makeup was banned in school and they were both in trouble.,0
"In fact, it seemed like nobody could get away with anything anymore.",0
"No illegal snacks, no talking out of turn, no play-fights, no sneaking into out-of-bound places like the bike sheds, and no mucking around of any kind at all between lessons.",0
"On Friday evening, the detention class after school was the biggest that anyone had known.",0
"It had thirty people in it, and twenty-seven of them had been put there by Miss Vile. And there are no prizes for guessing which teacher was wearing a very smug and satisfied smile on her face.",0
"Of course, Katie understood that Miss Vile was using the umbrella to make herself invisible.",0
But there was nothing she could do about it.,0
"It was a good thing that nobody else knew, or they would have all blamed Katie for the new reign of terror that was gripping the school.",0
"That weekend, Grandmother came to visit, and Katie had to admit what had happened to her umbrella.",0
"I’m really, really sorry Gran,",1
said Katie.,0
It’s terrible and I don’t know what to do about it.,1
"At first, Grandma was a little bit grumpy about her missing umbrella.",0
"All Sunday she kept on making remarks like,",0
"I only asked you to fetch it from the patisserie, not take it to school,",1
"It’s an antique not a toy,",1
you can’t get another one like that these days for love or money.,1
"And Mum chipped in too, telling Katie that it had been extremely silly of her to take such a valuable thing to school, and she only had herself to blame for what had happened.",0
"But by evening, Gran had softened her tone a bit, and just as she was getting ready to fly home, she said:",0
"You know Katie, I’m probably a fool to do this, but I’m going to lend you my spare spectacles.",1
"And this time you do have my permission to take them to school, only you must promise to be very careful with them.",1
"And she rumbled in her handbag – which was always so full of many more things than could possibly be kept in there, except by magic – and finally she found the case with her spare spectacles in them.",0
Katie put the glasses on and looked at herself in the mirror.,0
"They were a very ornate pair, made of gold and decorated with precious stones.",0
"Hmm, they don’t really suit your face, do they?",1
said Grandma. And she said a magic spell which made them look trendy – or rather Grandma’s idea of trendy – which meant the frames were large and square and bright blue.,0
"Thanks Grandma,",1
"said Katie,",0
"You’ll see,",1
said Grandma.,0
"Or rather, they will help you to see.",1
"On Monday morning, Katie wore Grandma’s glasses to school.",0
"Jenny said,",0
"Hello four eyes,",1
and Michelle thought they made her look cute.,0
But Isis said that they were a total fashion disaster.,0
Michael said,0
"I didn’t know you were short-sighted Katie,",1
"and Katie replied,",0
Neither did I ‘till yesterday.,1
It wasn’t until the break at lunchtime that Katie understood what the glasses were for.,0
Isabelle was walking down the corridor and she sneakily took a piece of chewing gum out of her pocket and put it into her mouth.,0
"Katie was walking towards her, and was trying to signal frantically that Miss Vile was standing in a doorway and had seen the whole crime – but it was too late.",0
Isabelle was signed up for detention.,0
"But of course what Katie also had seen, was that Miss Vile was holding up her umbrella over her head.",0
Now she understood that the glasses enabled her to see everything – even things and people that were invisible.,0
She decided to follow Miss Vile and see what she did next.,0
She saw her go into the playground and catch a boy who climbed over the fence into the caretaker’s yard to retrieve a lost football.,0
Then she saw Miss Vile go into the staff-room – and do you know what?,0
She didn’t take down her umbrella.,0
Katie came up to her and said:,0
"Hello Miss Vile, would you like a piece of chewing gum?",1
and Miss Vile said:,0
And Miss Vile smiled.,0
"No they wouldn’t, would they?",1
"But as it happens, teachers can’t break the school rules.",1
It would be setting a bad example and I would have to put myself in detention.,1
"Katie laughed and said,",0
"That’s good, because I don’t actually have any gum.",1
"But Miss, I’ve got a question.",1
Do you think it’s ok for teachers to use magic?,1
"And a rather uneasy smile passed over Miss Vile’s face, because she knew just as well as Katie that magic was against the school rules.",0
And not just a little bit against them.,0
"I mean,",1
"said Katie,",0
"if Miss Hepworth was to find out that your recent success at crime detection was all down to my Grandma’s magic umbrella, do you think she would be pleased?",1
"And As Miss Hepworth was the head-teacher, Miss Vile realised that that was something she would not like to happen at all.",0
Not one little bit.,0
"And wasn’t that a super story about Katie and her magic umbrella, I bet you wish that you had one.",0
"From me, Natasha, Goodbye!",0
"This story is about a little girl who is a witch, and it’s fair to say that it’s more sweet than spooky.",0
"Her name is Katie, and her school mates think she is rather odd, and don’t really believe that she can do magic.",0
"She’s afraid of Halloween, because she thinks they will tease her more than usual, but in fact she has quite a few useful tricks and treats up her sleeve.",0
"Read by Natasha. Duration eight.fifty-two Once upon a time, there was a girl called Katie. Katie was seven.",0
And she lived in nice house with her mum and a dog called Muffin. And it was all quite normal really.,0
Except for one thing.,0
They were witches.,0
"Well, except for Muffin, who was a D-witch, which is a dog who casts spells.",0
Anyway being a witch wasn’t so bad.,0
Mum would just twitch her nose and all the cleaning would get done.,0
"Dad would wave his stick, and the lawn would cut itself.",0
"Muffin would click his paws, and a few dog treats would tumble out of the sky.",0
They’d even taught Katie some magic.,0
She knew how to make her homework do itself.,0
And her room got tidied just by twitching her ear.,0
But there was just one thing Katie really didn’t like.,0
"Halloween. Once a year, when the leaves were falling off the trees, and the nights were getting longer, all the children in her school and along her street would get terribly excited about Halloween. They made costumes of horrible looking witches.",0
"With long pointy noses, and spots, and nasty black hats, and broomsticks.",0
And Katie said in school:,0
"Witches aren’t like that, really.",1
My mum looks quite nice.,1
And all the other girls fell about laughing.,0
"Katie thinks she’s a witch,",1
they laughed.,0
"She’s ugly and horrible, just like a witch.",1
"And when Katie went home that day, she was really upset.",0
She cried and cried and cried.,0
"And when her mum asked her what the matter was, she said:",0
Everyone hates witches.,1
And they especially hate them at Halloween.,1
"And her mum tried to explain that although some people didn’t like witches, it was also quite useful sometimes, like when the washing up got done all by itself.",0
"I don’t ever want to have anything to do with witch-craft again,",1
said Katie angrily.,0
"But on Halloween night, all the girls from her school were organising a trick or treat tour of the street.",0
"And Katie didn’t want to go, because she’d decided she didn’t want to have anything to do with witch-craft.",0
"Never, never, never....",0
But her mum said she had to.,0
Because a witch can hardly stay in on Halloween. And she whispered something in Katie’s ear.,0
Do you know what it was?,0
"Well, I’ll tell you in a minute.",0
"Anyway, Katie went to join the other girls.",0
And some of them started laughing at her.,0
"Katie doesn’t have to dress up, because she’s already a witch,",1
they laughed.,0
And Katie felt cross.,0
And embarrassed.,0
But she decided to say nothing.,0
"At the first house, they got a load of sherbet lemons.",0
"At the second, a jumbo pack of sweeties.",0
"At the third, loads and loads of crisps.",0
"And at the forth, a giant packet of chocolate biscuits.",0
"But at the fifth house, there lived a man called Mr Bones. And Mr Bones didn’t like children.",0
He certainly didn’t see why he should give them any treats.,0
"Buzz off, you stupid kids,",1
he said when they knocked on the door.,0
"Trick or treat, trick or treat...",1
cried the girls.,0
"Yes, well, I think I’ll take the trick, if it’s all the same to you,",1
said Mr Bones. And a horrible smile creased up his face.,0
"Because you’re just a bunch of stupid little girls, and you don’t scare me.",1
"But one of us is a real witch,",1
"said Amelia, the biggest of the girls.",0
"Yes, yes, Katie’s a real witch,",1
they all cried.,0
But Mr Bones just laughed and laughed.,0
"That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard,",1
he said.,0
"Go on, Katie,",1
said Amelia.,0
Let’s see if you really are a witch.,1
And so Katie stepped forwards.,0
"You don’t look scary to me,",1
said Mr Bones.,0
You’re just a stupid little girl.,1
But Katie remembered what her mum had whispered in her ear.,0
Do you know what it was?,0
A special spell.,0
"So right then, Katie recited the magic words.",0
And she wriggled her ear.,0
And all the girls gasped in amazement.,0
Because suddenly Mr Bones wasn’t Mr Bones anymore.,0
"He was a little brown, fluffy hamster.",0
Inside a cage.,0
Running around and around on a wheel.,0
All the girls laughed and laughed.,0
Katie leaned into the cage.,0
Is it fun being a hamster?,1
The little creature squeaked and shook its head.,0
"And Katie spun the wheel, so that he had to run faster and faster.",0
And then she recited the magic words and Mr Bones was turned back into a man again.,0
"I’ll get you some treats, girls,",1
he said very quickly and nervously.,0
"And he came back with tons of chocolate bars, fizzy drinks, biscuits, and even a new Barbie DVD for each girl.",0
"Please come back next year girls,",1
he said.,0
I’ll have even better stuff for you.,1
"And he went back inside, looking very nervous.",0
"And as they went down the rest of the street, everyone had heard that there was a real witch out trick and treating tonight, so they all gave the girls even more sweets and biscuits than usual, and even some toys.",0
And Katie was the most popular girl in her class.,0
"You know, maybe it’s not so bad being a witch after all,",1
she said when she got home.,0
And I think I’m going to enjoy Halloween from now on.,1
"All the courtiers say that the clothes are quite magnificent, and the Emperor plans to wear his new suit for the procession through the centre of the city.",0
The moral of this story rings so very true!,0
"What we are doing is totally absurd, but we can't stop because everybody else seems to believe that it's the right thing to do.",0
Yet they can probably see it's just as ridiculous as we can.,0
"The little boy who literally sees through the Emperor's New Clothes only appears for a moment, and yet he is one of the greatest heroes of all fairy tales - for he speaks the truth that nobody else dares to speak.",0
"Many years ago, there was an emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money on the finest suits.",0
He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers;,0
"nor did he care to go to the theatre or out hunting, except when there was a chance to show off his new clothes.",0
He had a different suit for each hour of the day.,0
"Just as you might say of any other king or emperor,",0
"He is sitting in his council,",1
"people used to say of him,",0
He is sitting in his wardrobe.,1
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital;,0
strangers arrived every day at the court.,0
"One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, came to the court.",0
They said that they knew how to weave clothes of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns.,0
"The clothes made from their cloths were like no others, for they were invisible to everyone who was either unfit for their job, or extremely simple in the head.",0
"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!",1
Thought the emperor.,0
"Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my empire are unfit for their jobs, and also be able to tell the wise from the foolish!",1
This stuff must be woven for me immediately.,1
He ordered large sums of money to be given to both the weavers so that they might begin their work.,0
"So the two false weavers set up two looms, and pretended to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all.",0
They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread;,0
"put both into their own knapsacks, and then continued their pretend work at the empty looms until late at night.",0
"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,",1
"said the emperor to himself, after some little time had gone by.",0
"He was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or someone unfit for his office, would be unable to see the results of their work.",0
"To be sure, he himself would not have any trouble seeing the clothes, but yet, thought it would be better to send somebody else to report on the weavers and their work.",0
All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful cloth;,0
"and all were anxious to earn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbours might prove to be.",0
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,",1
"said the emperor at last, after some thought",0
he will be best able to see how the cloth looks;,1
"for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.",1
"So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms.",0
What can be the meaning of this?,1
"Thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide.",0
I cannot see the least bit of thread on the looms.,1
"However, he did not speak his thoughts aloud.",0
The tricksters asked him very politely to be so good as to come nearer their looms;,0
"and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colours were not very beautiful - at the same time pointing to the empty frames.",0
"The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not see anything on the looms, for a very good reason:",0
There was nothing there.,0
What!,1
Thought he again.,0
Is it possible that I am a simpleton?,1
I have never thought so myself;,1
and no one must know it now if I am so.,1
"Can it be, that I am unfit for my office?",1
"No, that must not be said either.",1
I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.,1
"Well, Sir Minister!",1
"said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.",0
You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.,1
"Oh, it is excellent!",1
"Replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles.",0
"This pattern, and the colours, yes, I will tell the emperor without delay.",1
How very beautiful I think them.,1
"We shall be much obliged to you,",1
"said the impostors, and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretend stuff.",0
"The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the emperor;",0
"and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun.",0
"However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks and continued to work with as much pretend effort as before at their empty looms.",0
"The emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to find out whether the cloth would soon be ready.",0
It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;,0
"he looked at the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.",0
"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?",1
Asked the impostors of the emperor’s second ambassador;,0
"at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colours which were not there.",0
I certainly am not stupid!,1
Thought the messenger.,0
"It must be, that I am not fit for my good, well-paid job!",1
That is very odd;,1
"however, no one shall know anything about it.",1
"Therefore he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colours and patterns.",0
"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,",1
"said he to the emperor when he returned,",0
the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.,1
The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense.,0
"Now the emperor for himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom.",0
"Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they knew the emperor was on his way, went on working more hard than ever;",0
although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.,0
Is not the work absolutely magnificent?,1
"Said the two officers of the crown, who already who had been before.",0
If Your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it!,1
What a splendid design!,1
What glorious colours!,1
At the same time they pointed to the empty frames;,0
for they imagined that everyone else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.,0
How is this?,1
Said the emperor to himself.,0
I can see nothing!,1
This is indeed a terrible affair!,1
"Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an emperor?",1
That would be the worst thing that could happen,1
It has my complete approval.,1
"He smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms;",0
for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much.,0
"All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others;",0
"nevertheless, they all exclaimed,",0
"Oh, how beautiful!",1
"And advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the public procession which was due to take place soon.",0
Magnificent!,1
Charming!,1
Excellent!,1
Everyone said on all sides;,0
and everyone was uncommonly cheerful.,0
The emperor shared in the general satisfaction;,0
"and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their buttonholes, and the title of",0
Gentlemen Weavers.,1
"The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the emperor’s new suit.",0
They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms;,0
"cut the air with their scissors, and sewed with needles without any thread in them.",0
"Cried they, at last.",0
The emperor’s new clothes are ready!,1
"Now the emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers;",0
"and the rogues raised their arms, as if holding something up, saying,",0
Here are Your Majesty’s trousers!,1
Here is the scarf!,1
Here is the cloak!,1
The whole suit is as light as a cobweb;,1
"one might fancy one has nothing at all on, when one is dressed in it.",1
"That, however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.",1
Yes indeed!,1
"Said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see anything of this exquisite manufacture.",0
"If Your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.",1
"The emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit;",0
"the emperor turning round, from side to side, looking in the glass.",0
"How splendid His Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they fit!",1
Everyone cried out.,0
What a design!,1
What colours!,1
These are indeed royal robes!,1
"The canopy which is to be carried over Your Majesty, in the procession, is waiting,",1
announced the chief master of the ceremonies.,0
"I am quite ready,",1
answered the emperor.,0
Do my new clothes fit well?,1
"Asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.",0
"The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry His Majesty’s train felt about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the robes, and pretended to be carrying something;",0
for they would by no means let anyone see that they were simple or unfit for their jobs.,0
"So now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital.",0
"All the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried out,",0
How beautiful are our emperor’s clothes!,1
What a magnificent train there is to the robes and how gracefully the scarf hangs!,1
"In short, no one would allow that he could not see these much admired clothes - because, in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his job.",0
"Certainly, none of the emperor’s various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones.",0
But the emperor has nothing at all on!,1
Said a little child.,0
Listen to the voice of innocence!,1
Exclaimed his father;,0
and what the child had said was whispered from one to another.,0
But he has nothing at all on!,1
At last cried out all the people.,0
"The emperor was suddenly embarrassed, for he knew that the people were right;",0
but he thought the procession must go on now!,0
"And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up the robes although, in reality, there were no robes at all.",0
"And that’s the story of the Emperor’s New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen. Bertie says that in real life, people are often more silly in a crowd than they are on their own.",0
"If you think that everybody else believes something, then it must be true – and you have to be very brave to be like the little boy in the story and stand up and say what can see with your own eyes.",0
The making of this story was more of a team effort than usual.,0
"Natasha really wanted Bertie to write a story about Katie’s mum, and she was keen on mentioning the persecution of witches.",0
"Along the way, there were some great suggestions from our listeners Eric and Melissa in Milford, Massachusetts, who saw an early version.",0
"They suggested the idea of the Street Festival and the intervention of Isis’s mum in the role of the head of the Chamber of Commerce. And finally our illustrator, CiaJia, thought up the idea for the storm.",0
There were so many great ideas that it’s a bit longer than usual.,0
We hope you will enjoy this rather different Katie story.,0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Pictures by CaiJia Eng. Duration twenty-four minutes.,0
Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. Katie’s mother loved her job.,0
There was nothing in the whole wide world that she would rather be than a witch.,0
She loved the feeling of magic tingling through her fingers.,0
The chanting of incantations was music to her ears.,0
She always enjoyed meeting other witches and swapping spells with them.,0
"It was always satisfying to help people out with a little dose of magic, and most often, they did not even have an inkling about what she had done.",0
But being a witch wasn’t all hunky dory.,0
"These days, when everyone is so into high tech gadgetry, magic is quite out of fashion.",0
It’s really tough to earn a living out of it.,0
And you have to be very thick skinned.,0
"In fact, if some people find out that you are a witch, or even suspect it, they can become quite nasty about you – vicious and vindictive even.",0
"But despite all the difficulties, Katie’s mother still believed that witchcraft had a great future.",0
"In fact, she had a little ambition.",0
She had always wanted to own a shop where she could sell magical things.,0
"But of course she couldn’t say that they were magical, so she would just have to present them as a bit mystical and unusual.",0
"She would stock hard-to-find ingredients like Mandrake’s Root, Stardust, and Glastonbury Grass Seed. Of course she would absolutely NOT sell Powdered Unicorn Horn, because, although it is very powerful in spells, Unicorns are an endangered species.",0
"She would also have things for about the home, like pillows stuffed with dodo down, sweet smelling candles, broomsticks, and cauldrons.",0
"She would have a jewellery counter, with pendants and bangles in the shape of magical symbols.",0
"And in the back of the shop, out of view from ordinary customers, she would stock a wide range of the best books and scrolls all about magic.",0
"One afternoon at the school gate, Katie said to her mother:",0
"Mum, I would love to be a famous film actor when I grow up.",1
And her mother said:,0
"Well, if that’s what you want to do, you should do something positive about it, like audition for the school play.",1
"Mum, I ever so want to do the auditions, but I’m afraid that people will laugh at me.",1
Jenny said that I can never be a film star because I look way too geeky.,1
And since when was Jenny Miss Know-it-all about Hollywood?,1
Don’t listen to her opinion.,1
"I’ve learned one thing in my life, if you want something you’ve got to just go for it, or else you will spend the rest of your days living with your regrets.",1
And Katie kissed her mother because she always gave her such good advice.,0
"That evening, Katie’s mum put a new spell into the dishwasher that magically collected all the dirty dishes, washed them, and then put them back in the cupboard.",0
"She was particularly proud of that spell because it improved on modern technology, and she had written it herself.",0
And Katie thought,0
I must have the cleverest mum in the whole school.,1
"Later on, when Katie was in bed, and about to turn out her light, her mother popped into her room to wish her sweet dreams.",0
And Katie said:,0
"Mum, you know what you said about not going for what you want, and then regretting not doing it.",1
And her mum said:,0
Yes. What about it?,1
And Katie said:,0
Is there anything you regret not doing?,1
"And Katie’s mum thought for a while, and replied:",0
"Well you know I’ve always wanted to open a magic shop, but I’ve never got round to doing it.",1
Well why don’t you?,1
asked Katie.,0
Because people might say it was a bit strange...,0
"Don’t listen to ‘people,",1
"urged Katie,",0
just do it.,1
Or you will always regret not doing it.,1
You know you will.,1
And Katie’s mother said:,0
"Time for you, my little witch, to go to sleep now.",1
Oh go on mum.,1
Say you will.,1
Well perhaps I shall.,1
"In the morning, Katie’s mother woke up with fiery determination in her belly.",0
She had already spotted that there was a little shop for rent on the high street.,0
"After she had dropped Katie off at school, she went to speak to the landlord of the shop, who told her how much it would cost every month.",0
"First she thought that the rent was rather a lot of money, then she remembered how she would have to buy all the stock, and then she thought that going into the shop business was so terribly risky.",0
And then at last she thought:,0
Well Katie’s right.,1
"If I don’t give it a try, I will always regret it.",1
"And so the following weekend, Katie and her mother started to decorate the shop.",0
"They painted it white, because they were white witches, but they decorated it with all sorts of wavy magical patterns.",0
"They called it,",0
The Magic Lantern,1
"and inside, where nobody could see, they used just a little magic to whitewash all the walls.",0
"Katie’s mother ordered all the stock, which arrived by magic, and they were able to open it within a week.",0
"Magic might be a bit old fashioned,",1
"said Katie’s mum,",0
But it’s still a big time-saver.,1
But Katie and her mum weren’t the only people to see how quickly and easily things were getting done around the shop.,0
"From the shop next door, and from the window across the precinct, eyes were watching them.",0
"The owner of the home furnishings shop that had been there simply forever, saw that she had a rival shop.",0
"She went to see her friend, the owner of the launderette, and said:",0
You’ve got to watch these witches.,1
"They will be washing clothes by magic next, and that’s what I call unfair competition.",1
And she went to see the owner of the patisserie shop and said:,0
She’s not exactly friendly is she?,1
She hasn’t been over to say hello yet.,1
"Perhaps the ears of Katie’s mum should have been burning with all this gossip about her buzzing around the street, but she was far too excited about her new business to notice that sort of thing.",0
On Monday morning she snapped her fingers and the sign on the door flipped from Closed to Open. She sat down with a cup of tea and waited for her first customer:,0
"I mustn’t be too impatient,",1
"she said to herself,",0
Monday morning is bound to be slow.,1
But at nine.fifteen her first customer came in.,0
"He was a young man, and it was so exciting watching him browse through her wares.",0
"First he looked around the home accessories, and then his eye caught the jewellery counter.",0
She guessed that he was looking for a present for his girlfriend.,0
She summoned up all her courage to speak to him:,0
Can I help you with anything?,1
she asked.,0
"Er yes, my girlfriend loves all this magical sort of stuff and it’s her birthday tomorrow.",1
"She was dying to ask if his girlfriend was a witch, but she thought that it might be tactless to ask.",0
She didn’t want her first customer to think she was being rude.,0
"When the young man chose a pendant and paid for it with his credit card she wanted to hug and kiss him, though of course she didn’t, she merely said:",0
Thank you sir.,1
I hope your girlfriend likes the present.,1
"When he had gone out of the shop, she did a little dance and shouted",0
Yippee!,1
"By eleven o’clock there were three or four customers browsing around the shop and in the early afternoon a tourist bus broke down just outside window, and the passengers poured out onto the street.",0
Most of them poured into her shop and were saying things like:,0
"Oh Hank, just look at this little lantern, isn’t it adorable?",1
None of this went unnoticed by the other shopkeepers.,0
"She’s a witch you know,",1
said the baker.,0
"She put a spell on that bus,",1
said the newspaper agent.,0
"And on all her customers,",1
added the gift shop owner.,0
"Just before fourpm Katie’s mum put a sign on the door saying,",0
Back Soon,1
"and she ran down the road to pick up Katie from her school, which fortunately was not far away.",0
"As soon as Katie saw her mother’s face, she knew that her first day of shopkeeping had already been a success.",0
How many customers?,1
she asked eagerly.,0
"I’ve lost count,",1
said her mum.,0
And they both rushed back to the shop where they found a couple of customers peering through the window at the Wizard’s Writing Desk which was the most expensive item on view.,0
"Not long after, the credit card machine was cheerfully printing out a receipt.",0
"Customers continued to drop into her shop, including some local witches, and even a wizard who had flown a one hundred miles by broomstick just to come to it.",0
"But even with all the customers, there were quiet times when it was quite lonely in the shop, and she longed to chat to the other shopkeepers nearby.",0
But they all gave her a cold shoulder.,0
And things got worse.,0
"One morning when she came in, she found that somebody had spray-canned some dreadful words over her window:",0
Witches Out!,1
"Oh dear,",1
"said Katie’s mother,",0
somebody doesn’t like me.,1
"And without thinking she snapped her fingers, and the window was immediately clean again.",0
"And then she thought,",0
Oh silly me.,1
I hope nobody saw me do that.,1
"That afternoon, Katie left the school in the happiest of moods.",0
She had just been given a lead part in the school play.,0
"It was called The Witches of Salem, and was set in New England in the one thousand, six hundred and ninetys when women were put on trial for being witches.",0
Mr Holkham said the part was just made for me!,1
said Katie with a huge smile on her face.,0
Oh that’s fantastic darling.,1
"You’ve done so well,",1
said her mother as they sat in the car.,0
"But by the time they reached the traffic lights, Katie could tell that something was troubling her mother.",0
"Later that evening, when she was making soup in the kitchen, she told Katie all about the",0
Witches Out!,1
graffiti.,0
"Oh dear,",1
"said Katie,",0
I think you are being persecuted.,1
And her mother had to wipe a tear from her eye as she tried to look brave.,0
"They next day, when Katie told her best friend Isis all about what had happened, she said:",0
It’s just like in the school play.,1
It’s a witch hunt.,1
I’m just so afraid for my mum.,1
She’s so nice.,1
She hates fighting.,1
And Isis thought and said:,0
"If she hates fighting, she shouldn’t do it.",1
She needs a charm offensive.,1
What’s a charm offensive?,1
asked Katie.,0
"It’s like when you think up a plan to win over people’s hearts,",1
said Isis.,0
She mustn’t get hurt.,1
She mustn’t hit back.,1
She must be true to herself and be nice to everyone.,1
That’s what I think anyway.,1
"Katie thought that a charm offensive sounded like a brilliant plan, and after school she told her mother what Isis had said.",0
"Well of course she’s right,",1
"said her mum,",0
I must try to win over the shopkeepers.,1
But it’s hard not to feel paranoid when everyone’s out to get you.,1
"What Katie’s mum needed was a little sign to point her in the right direction, and the very next day she found one quite unexpectedly.",0
"She received a visit in the shop from somebody she knew, although not very well.",0
"The visitor was dressed in a smart two piece suit, she wore a string of pearls around her neck, and carried a little briefcase.",0
"She was head of the local Chamber of Commerce, which is like a club for all the local shops and businesses, and as it happened, she was also Isis’s mum.",0
"I thought you might like to help us,",1
said Isis’s mum.,0
We are holding a street festival and we need lots of things.,1
Like what?,1
asked Katie’s mum.,0
"Oh like food, and balloons, and party games for the children.",1
"Well I think the Magic Lantern could help with that,",1
she said.,0
"And if you like, I’ll help with the organisation too.",1
"Brilliant,",1
said Isis’s mum.,0
"And for the next six weeks, Katie’s mum worked ever so hard at organising the street party.",0
She made a brochure and a website which advertised all the local shops.,0
She drew up plans showing where all the stalls would be.,0
"She cut out bunting, blew up balloons, baked cakes, and she ordered a bouncy castle, a children's magician, and a jazz band.",0
"On the morning of the big day, the sun was shining, and the crowds came out to mill around the open-air stalls.",0
"Women browsed through designer clothes, husbands looked for nice but not too expensive presents for their wives, and children's faces were all messy with icecream.",0
The lady from the gift shop brought her family dog with her.,0
"It was a lovely great big bouncy red setter, who liked nothing more than to jump up and lick your face.",0
His owner unclipped his lead and whispered in his fluffy ear:,0
"Tiggy darling, go and find the witch,",1
and because he was a clever dog he understood exactly what she meant.,0
He bounded over to the stall where Katie’s mum had set out her wares.,0
"He jumped up onto it and liked her face, sending pendants, rings, and magic charms scattering in all directions.",0
The whole stall tipped over and Katie’s fizzy orange drink spilled all over a customer’s dress.,0
The gift shop owner came running over and said to Katie’s mum:,0
Did you just try and put a spell on my dog?,1
He’s as good as gold except when there’s a witch around.,1
"And Katie’s mum was so upset that she didn’t notice that a thief was picking up rings off the ground and palming them, while his accomplice was helping herself to the upturned cash box.",0
"Oh dear,",1
"she thought,",0
"I wish I could use a bit of magic to tidy all this up, but I can’t with so many people around.",1
"But Katie and Isis helped her to sort out the mess and set things right in no time, and before long the customers were buying her things again.",0
"The lady from the flower shop whispered to the newsagent,",0
You just can’t keep a bad witch down.,1
"But around lunch time, grey clouds began to blow over the sky, and the street became darker and quite chilly.",0
"Some people went into cafes, but others started to drift away back home.",0
Drops of rain were already starting to land on the stores.,0
"Now might be a good time to make the sun come out,",1
"said the lady from the patisserie shop to Katie’s mum, not actually saying that she was a witch, but just making sure that they both understood what she meant.",0
Just then a gust of wind blew down the street and blew away all cards from the gift stall.,0
"Instead of picking them up, she ran over to Katie’s mum and screeched:",0
You did that on purpose didn’t you?,1
"I don’t know what you mean,",1
protested Katie’s mum.,0
Yes you do you witch.,1
You are getting your own back.,1
"While she was accusing Katie’s mum, the rain was soaking the clothes, and ruining the cakes.",0
The store owners were hastily gathering up their things and taking them back inside the shops.,0
"Oh dear, the party is ruined,",1
said Isis’ mum.,0
"But the storm only lasted half an hour, and afterwards the sun came out shining in all the puddles and making the whole street look glistening and beautiful.",0
"‘Well it’s too late for us,",0
"because half our cards and gifts are soaked, and the other half are lost, thanks to that witch.",1
Then she looked up and saw Katie standing there:,0
What do you want?,1
said the angry shopkeeper.,0
"We want to help you,",1
said Katie.,0
"Why don’t you take Tiggy for a walk down the street for fifteen minutes, and when you come back, I promise that things will be much better.",0
"Pah, said the lady.",0
"More tricks and witchery,",1
"but she was so fed up, that she did take Tiggy down the road to the park.",0
"While she was away, Katie’s mum said a little magic spell.",0
"She didn’t actually collect all the lost cards in one go, because that would be too noticeable, but it did help Katie and Isis find them all ten times as quickly as they would normally, and when they picked them up, they were all clean.",0
"All the way down the street, the stall owners were making light work of setting up everything again, and Katie’s mum, who had already reset her stall, was lending a helping hand wherever she could.",0
"Everyone was saying how unlucky it had been that the storm had blown down the street, but as everyone was helping each other, there were cheerful smiles and jokes all round.",0
"When the gift store owner returned, she found that her store was set up as well, if not better, than before.",0
"Well thank you,",1
she said grudgingly to Katie.,0
"Don’t thank me, thank my mum,",1
"replied Katie. And although the gift store owner did not quite go as far as to thank Katie’s mum, she never said a bad word against her again, and from that day on, all the other shopkeepers on the street said things like:",0
"Well she might be a witch, but she’s still a nice person.",1
"Lapis, the ancient Egyptian cat, returns in this spooky two-part adventure We cats have our hates.",0
"We hate water ( except to drink), crocodiles, snakes, fleas, rotten fish, feeling hungry, dirt, stupid dogs, and all sorts of ghosts and spectres.",0
"So if this story is a bit scary, I’m sorry, I can’t help it.",0
Spooky stuff happens sometimes.,0
It was the time of the month when Lord Khonsu is round and fat.,0
"Oh, I am forgetting, you future people don’t call the gods by the names we use.",0
I had better let you know that Lord Khonsu is the moon god.,0
"Around midnight, my sister friend, Chloe, and I were sitting on the roof of the house belonging to Nanoona, the priestess.",0
"We were enjoying the aroma of grilled fish that was still lingering around the smoke hole in her roof, just above the stove where she cooks.",0
"All was quiet - but here’s the thing - the deadliest danger isn’t yappy like a dog, or hissy like a bandit cat - it sneaks up silently.",0
Chloe and I both felt it at the same time.,0
It was the feeling you get along your spine when a snake slithers out of the grass just in front of you.,0
It was like UGGGGGGG!,0
"Only it wasn’t in front of us, we both knew that whatever it was lurked behind us.",0
"We wanted to run, but our legs were frozen.",0
A moment or two later a large white cat sat down beside us.,0
What are you doing?,1
he asked.,0
Can’t you smell?,1
murmured Chloe.,0
We are savouring the smoke from the grilled fish.,1
I can’t smell anymore.,1
"Poor you,",1
"I said,",0
have you lost your nose in a fight?,1
said the white cat.,0
We dead cats can’t smell.,1
Chloe and I both shuddered.,0
"Did you say, d-d-d,",1
"asked Chloe, but she could not finish the dreadful word.",0
The pale cat nodded.,0
"Well,",1
"I said,",0
Nice meeting you.,1
It’s time for us to be heading off.,1
Our master will be worried that we’re not back.,1
And then Chloe and I both legged it across the rooftops faster than a pair of shooting stars.,0
"Back home, I pawed at Amon’s sleeping head.",0
"He’s our master, a priest at the temple of lady bastet, and he understands our language.",0
"Amon, Amon,",1
we meowed.,0
What is it?,1
"he asked drowsily,",0
you look like you just saw a ghost.,1
We did!,1
we both screeched.,0
Don’t be silly kitties,1
"said Amon now sitting up,",0
Ghosts aren’t allowed out of the underworld.,1
Lord Osiris is strict.,1
"Once a spirit has been admitted to the Field of Reeds, there’s no turning back.",1
"You just got spooked by some shadow or something,",1
"He was so certain that spirits are not allowed to flit around the living world, that we began to think that he was right - and the cat we had met wasn’t a ghost, just some kind of freaky weirdo.",0
"Even so, we both thought it safer to skip the midnight strolls.",0
"It was about a week later, when we were curled up on the foot of Amnon’s bed, when we were awoken by a caterwauling and screeching so deafening and scary that even Amon exclaimed:",0
Ye Gods !,1
Has every spirit been released from the underworld?,1
You told us that was impossible!,1
I reminded him.,0
It’s is!,1
"answered Amon,",0
"But sometimes the impossible happens, before adding, ",0
"Well, don’t just sit there, go and find out what’s making that row!",1
Are you kidding?,1
We both replied shaking our heads.,0
We’re going to hide in the cupboard until the dreadful noise stops.,1
Which is what we did.,0
The terrifying sounds continued to rip through the night skies until Lord Ra’s red sun peeked over the horizon in the East. By dawn we were certain that the world must have ended amid some end-of-days war between the gods.,0
"But when we finally peaked through the slats of the window shutters, we saw that our neighbours houses were still standing, and the River Nile was gently flowing, not flooding nor dried up, and no gods were flying around the sky in their chariots.",0
"By Lady Bastet,",1
"said Amon,",0
apocalypse has been postponed.,1
Which was a priest’s fancy way of saying that the world had not ended just yet.,0
It was at Lady Bastet’s temple that we learned what had happened.,0
"As I have mentioned before, there are thousands of stray cats who stay on the steps of the temple, competing for the scraps thrown by the priests and the pilgrims.",0
"Every so often, some wicked priests catch a whole load of cats and turn them into mummies to sell to the tourists.",0
"It’s one of the hazards of hanging around the temple, and is why we are so lucky that Amon took us into his house.",0
This is what we learned.,0
"In the middle of night, the temple cats were almost spooked out of their skins by an invasion - an army of ghost cats and shining luminous skeletons came running across the surface of the river Nile and up onto the steps of the temple.",0
That was when the apocalyptic screeching shredded our peaceful sleep.,0
"As the temple is on an island, the living cats had nowhere to run.",0
"The Nile is wet and full of crocodiles, and nobody in their right minds wants to dip a paw into those waters.",0
"Some cats hid, some fought, some ran around in circles.",0
The chaos and screaming continued until dawn when the dead cats departed as suddenly as they had arrived.,0
"In the morning, the chief priest, Simon the Greek, called an emergency meeting of all the priests and priestesses.",0
He spoke from the top of the temple steps and of course we cats listened with pricked up ears.,0
"This is a cataclysmic catastrophe,",1
"he declared, which was priest-speak for",0
bad - seriously bad.,1
Never In my whole career have I seen such a marketing disaster.,1
Tourists from the Pharaoh's palace were sleeping in the Sanctuary of Heracles just behind the temple.,1
They almost died of fright and could not sail away fast enough.,1
I must warn you.,1
Business is going to take a downturn.,1
"People come to the cat temple for a great day out, not to meet the spirits of the dead.",1
We all knew that this could not have come at a worse time.,0
The rival cat Temple at Alexandria was growing in popularity and had already been stealing business from us before this spooky news.,0
No tourists would mean no scraps.,0
Kitties’ bellies would go empty.,0
"On the plus side, there would be less demand for mummified cats.",0
"After that, the boats that travel up and down the Nile sailed on past our temple island without stopping, and the priests’ souvenir shop was as quiet as a Pharaoh’s tomb.",0
"The scary spectors continued to stalk around the island at night, and sometimes scrimished with the living cats.",0
"Chloe and I reckoned we were safe enough, so long as we did not set a paw outside the house when it was dark.",0
"That was until Amon told us one day,",0
Simon the Greek has asked to see you two in his office.,1
This was the worst possible news.,0
"A few weeks back, we had caught Simon trying to sell off a sacred statue.",0
We both knew that he was itching for revenge.,0
Simon was the highest of high priests at the cat temple.,0
When we entered his office we had to show respect by kissing his feet with our noses.,0
By Osiris !,0
He hadn’t washed this feet since walking to work that morning!,0
"‘Meeow, we are at your service,’ we both said, looking up at him.",0
I did not like the way he was holding his sharp quill pen.,0
It looked like he wanted to throw it at us.,0
He told us:,0
"‘Lady Bastet in her wisdom has chosen you as her most highly favoured cats,’ he said.",0
We nodded - in fact we both knew that was the one reason he had not had us skinned.,0
"‘Therefore,’ he went on, ‘I am entrusting you both with a mission that is vital to the future of the temple.’ ‘What mission is that?’ I asked, my voice trembling.",0
"‘You must visit the land of the dead and ask Lord Osiris to stop letting the dead cats to go out at night and walk through the land of the living.’ ‘But, But,’ said Chloe, ‘you can’t reach the land of the dead unless you are dead.’ ‘If it’s a problem I can help you with that,’ said Simon, with a little smile that showed his gold teeth.",0
It gave me the creeps.,0
"‘No, no, we can manage on our own,’ I replied, hastily.",0
‘I’ve heard they are letting visitors into the Land of the Dead these days.,0
We’ll get there just fine even though we are alive.’ We left the office of Simon the Greek in the most downcast of moods.,0
"Before we returned home we sat in the harbour and looked at the River Nile, and the peaceful marshes behind it, until Lord Ra pulled the burning sun down behind the horizon.",0
"They say the sun visits the land of the dead at night, ",0
 I told Chloe. ,0
How will we get there?,1
she asked.,0
"And more importantly, how how we get back?",1
I added.,0
"We were both meowing piteously when our master, Amon, came to find us.",0
"We heard his voice calling,",0
"Lapis, Chloe, here kitty-kitties, where are you?",1
We both came running up to his big feet.,0
"Here you are, ",0
 he said.,0
I was worried when you did not come home for dinner.,1
"Perhaps we will never come home for dinner again,",1
I replied.,0
Because Simon the Greek has ordered us to visit the Land of the Dead.,1
"Amon has a short temper, but deep down he loves us - we cats can tell that sort of thing you know.",0
He took us both up in his big hands and placed Chloe on his left shoulder and me on his right.,0
This is how we rode home in style.,0
"Now as every cat who hangs around the temple knows, Amon is the most highly skilled magician around these parts - which is why most of us think that he should be the highest of high priests in the place of Simon the Greek. If there is spell worth knowing, then Amon knows it.",0
The most important scrolls in his collection make up the Book of the Dead. Wealthy people pay him good money to teach them the spells they will need to reach the Field of Reeds when they pass into the next life.,0
Now he gave us a quick lesson.,0
"You have a long journey ahead of you, ",0
 he told us.,0
You will take a boat along the dark river.,0
"When you reach the hall of Maat, a god will ask you, ",0
"Have you ever made anyone cry?’ And you must reply, ",0
"No, not ever.",1
"Next a god will ask you,",0
Have you ever told a lie?,1
"And you must reply,",0
"No, not ever.",1
Have you got that?,0
we both said.,0
"And finally a god will ask you, ",0
Have you ever peed in the River Nile?,1
And what do you think your reply should be?’,0
"Why yes, of course,",1
I said.,0
"Amon shook his head,",0
"No, no no, you silly Kitty, ‘no’ is correct answer.",1
"But that would be lying,",1
protested Chloe.,0
"I know, I know, everyone, even the Pharaoh, has to tell a fib or two to reach the Field of Reeds in the Land of the Dead. But don’t worry.",1
I shall give you both magical collars that will keep your heart from betraying you.,1
"When you are wearing these collars, you can tell as many lies as you like, and you will always be believed.",1
"By the way, you must promise to give them back to me when you return.",1
"If we return,",1
I said sadly.,0
"You shall, you shall,",1
"Amon reassured us, before adding,",0
I think.,1
What do you mean you think?,1
demanded Chloe with a swish of her tail.,0
"I mean,",1
"said Amon,",0
"Is that it makes no sense to keep living cats in the Land of the Dead, so I have good reason to hope that Osiris will allow you to return to the Land of the living.",1
"In fact, he’ll probably kick you out!",1
"Katie returns in a new tale in which she gets into trouble, big trouble, at school.",0
Katie has twice as much school work to do as all the other kids.,0
"She has to learn loads and loads of magic spells, as well as her written spelling, arithmetic, geography, french and history.",0
She finds that it’s ever so tempting just to use a little bit of magic in her ordinary school exams.,0
And that’s when her trouble begins.,0
Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration sixteen.fifteen.,0
"Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. In fact, everyone would have been really, really happy, except for one thing.",0
"Before the holidays, they had to do exams.",0
"And nobody likes to do exams, unless they are the swottiest of swots.",0
And Katie didn’t think that exams were at all nice.,0
"No matter how good you are at magic, you still have to remember things for yourself.",0
And Katie had twice as much to learn as all the other children.,0
She had to do the witch exams as well as the ordinary school exams.,0
She did the witch exams in the evenings – and her mum gave her four and a half stars for her work.,0
But then she had to get ready for the tests at her school.,0
"Mum, it’s not fair",1
she complained.,0
I have to learn so many magic spells.,1
And I have to learn all the school lessons too.,1
"Well just think yourself lucky,",1
said Mum.,0
"Other children have to tidy their rooms, but you can just say a magic spell and it’s done just like that!",1
So Katie sat in her room and tried to read her school books.,0
"But to tell you the truth, she also looked out of the window and made up fairy tales about herself.",0
"Only in the stories, she wasn’t a witch.",0
She was a beautiful princess who could also do magic tricks.,0
"When exam week came, the first test was spelling.",0
"If it had been magic spelling, Katie would have been alright.",0
But in this test the teacher read out words like,0
accommodation,1
Mississippi,1
and other words that are tricky to spell.,0
Katie was really cross.,0
She thought the teacher had chosen the most difficult words just to be mean.,0
That wasn’t fair.,0
So she tried a little magic.,0
"She couldn’t say a spell out loud, because everyone would hear.",0
So she just thought the words in her head really hard – and Wow!,0
It worked.,0
Her pen wrote the correct spellings all by itself.,0
Next they had to do maths problems.,0
Katie could do the first few – because they were easy-peasy – but then there was a mean question about a monkey and some bananas.,0
"So she thought up another magic spell, and again her pen wrote down the right answer.",0
"In history, she had to remember all the names of the gods of ancient Egypt. And in geography she had to remember the capital cities of Europe. And in french she had to remember some really, really tricky words like",0
le singe est sur la branche ,0
 which means ,0
the monkey is on the branch.,1
"In fact, all the exams had mean questions in them.",0
"And in every case, a little magic spell came in handy.",0
"In fact, the magic worked so well for Katie that she thought to herself:",0
Why should I bother learning all these stupid things?,1
I can just say a magic spell and my pen will write the answer.,1
"The week after that, the teacher finished marking all the papers.",0
"She told the class that they had all done very well, especially Katie who had scored top marks in every exam.",0
She hadn’t got a single answer wrong.,0
"Wow Katie,",1
said Julie.,0
You’re a genius.,1
The teacher said:,0
Congratulations Katie. You certainly did very well.,1
Maybe too well.,1
I think that you and I should go and have a little talk with Mrs Hepworth.,1
And Katie felt just a bit worried.,0
Because Mrs Hepworth is the head mistress.,0
"And when you go to have a little talk with Mrs Hepworth, that usually means that you are in trouble.",0
Big trouble!,0
"At lunchtime, the teacher took Katie to see Mrs Hepworth. She explained that Katie had got top marks in all her exams and hadn’t got a single question wrong.",0
"You are a very naughty girl,",1
said Mrs Hepworth. And Katie started to cry.,0
And to cry.,0
And to cry.,0
And the teacher dried her tears with a handkerchief.,0
"There there,",1
she said.,0
Eventually Katie stopped crying.,0
Do you know why you are a naughty girl?,1
asked Mrs Hepworth. Katie said:,0
You’re just cross with me because I’m a witch and I know how to do magic.,1
That’s really mean of you because I can’t help being a witch.,1
I was born that way.,1
Now you are talking nonsense.,1
said Mrs Hepworth. There are no such things as witches or magic.,0
You are in trouble because you cheated in the exams.,0
I did not not NOT!,1
said Katie.,0
"Just tell us how you did it, and we will let you off – this time,",1
said the teacher.,0
Katie knew that she was in big trouble.,0
She just wanted to run out of the study and all the way back home to her mum.,0
"But she couldn’t do that, so she thought she had better own up.",0
"Well I did do a few magic spells,",1
she said.,0
Just little ones.,1
But they didn’t believe her.,0
Oh dear.,1
What are we going to do with this problem child?,1
said the teacher.,0
Katie.,1
said Mrs Hepworth.,0
"You are in big, big trouble.",1
You have till the end of term to tell us how you cheated in the exams.,1
"If you don’t tell the truth by then, you won’t be coming back to school next term.",1
We don’t have girls who make up stories about witches and magic in this school.,1
Goodness gracious!,1
You’ll be frightening all the other children with these silly stories.,1
"And Katie was very very sad about that, because she was telling the truth about being a witch.",0
And it wasn’t fair.,0
It was the last week of term.,0
"And before the holidays, the school always had a special treat.",0
"This term, Katie’s class went on a trip to the safari park.",0
"It was a big park full of wild animals from places like Africa. There were giraffes, and elephants, and long-legged deer called gazelles.",0
"Katie’s class were all safe inside the bus, and they looked out of the window at all the animals.",0
It was ever so cool.,0
Everyone was really excited and happy.,0
"Except for Katie. She was sad because she was still in big, big trouble.",0
The best animals were the chimpanzees.,0
They climbed all over the bus.,0
The driver got really cross when they stole his windscreen wipers.,0
Everyone else thought that was ever so funny.,0
And the lions were good too.,0
Even if they were a bit scary.,0
They had lunch in a restaurant on top of a tall rock.,0
The rock was on a big island surrounded by water.,0
And in the water there were crocodiles.,0
And the crocodiles were really scary.,0
Even more scary than the lions.,0
There was boy in Katie’s class called Clive. Clive was always doing silly things.,0
But the teachers didn’t seem to mind.,0
"Clive never got into trouble, however silly he was.",0
"But then, he didn’t know how to do magic.",0
So that was probably why he always got away with things.,0
"In the restaurant, Clive did something very silly indeed.",0
"He asked to go to the loo, and on the way back, he went through a door that said:",0
Staff Only.,1
And from there he went down a corridor and found a special room.,0
It was the room which they used to feed the crocodiles.,0
"It had a window and the keepers threw meat out of it, down into the river.",0
And somebody had left the window open.,0
Clive climbed up to look through the window.,0
"Then he saw that if you climbed out of the window, you could get onto the rocks.",0
"He thought it would be really cool to walk around the rocks, and look in at the other children eating their lunch.",0
They would get a really big surprise to see him out there.,0
So that’s what he did.,0
Only he slipped on a banana skin left by a monkey.,0
"Then, he fell down the rocks and broke his ankle.",0
"Fortunately, one of the keepers saw him and sounded the alarm.",0
"Everyone in the restaurant rushed to the window to look out, and they saw Clive lying on a rock near the river.",0
A crocodile was waddling slowly towards him.,0
"Its face had a sort of smile on it, and its tail was swishing.",0
Everyone screamed.,0
Except for Katie and Wendy. Wendy knew that Katie was a witch because once she had turned her into a toad for a short time.,0
Katie. Do something.,1
You’re the only one who can save poor Clive. Just say a magic spell.,1
Quick!!!!,1
Mrs Hepworth heard this.,0
"But she was too frightened to tell off either Wendy or Katie. After all, poor Clive was looking into the jaws of a crocodile.",0
Katie thought really hard about what would be the best magic spell to do.,0
And then she decided:,0
I know.,1
I will make Clive fly.,1
"Fortunately, she knew the spell to make somebody fly, off by heart.",0
She had learned it when she was getting ready for her witch exams.,0
Now she shouted it out at the top of her voice.,0
"I can’t tell you what she said, because it’s a secret.",0
"But it worked well, because everyone saw Clive rise up in the air, and gently fly back up to the restaurant.",0
Even the crocodile was impressed.,0
Then Katie said another spell to make everyone forget what they had just seen.,0
Except for the crocodile.,0
"And Mrs Hepworth. After that, Katie wasn’t in trouble any more.",0
Because Mrs Hepworth now knew that she was telling the truth when she said she was a witch.,0
And Katie was glad that she had worked very hard that term – to learn all her magic spells.,0
"And when she got home and told her family what had happened, her mum gave her another half star for passing her witch exams.",0
So now Katie is a five star witch.,0
"In this story, Katie and her best friend Isis go on a Pony Trek. If you like horses, you’ll definitely love this story, and even if you aren’t quite such a horsey person, you will learn about a scary modern legend that has grown up in the western part of England called Cornwall. Story by Bertie. Read by Natasha. Duration nineteen Minutes. Pictures by CaiJia Eng Proofread by Jana Elizabeth. It was the first day of term in the New Year.  Isis was standing in the playground talking to Judith and Andy about their holidays.",0
"All three of them had lovely suntans, Judith and Andy from their skiing trips, and Isis from her stay on a Caribbean island.",0
"When Katie joined them, she had her usual pale white skin, with a touch of red on her nose from the cold winter air.",0
"Oh hi Katie, what did you do for Christmas?",1
asked Isis.,0
"Oh Mum and I went to Grandma’s as usual,",1
"replied Katie.   That evening, as Katie’s mum ladled out her home-made pumpkin soup for dinner, Katie asked:",0
Why can’t we be rich like Isis and her mum?,1
"I mean, we’re witches, so we could easily magic up some money and then we could go on lovely holidays and I could have a pony.",1
"Oh Katie,",1
replied her mother.,0
We can’t do that.,1
Only the Government is allowed to make money.,1
"Using magic to do it is called alchemy, and it’s against the law.",1
said Katie.,0
That’s a pity.,1
"Isis is always talking about her pony, and I would really like to have one too.",1
"Well maybe she will let you ride hers,",1
said her mother softly.,0
"Ponies aren’t just expensive, they are a lot of work, and I’m sure that Isis could do with some help looking after hers.",1
"On Friday morning, Isis said to Katie,",0
Why don’t you come down to the pony farm with me tomorrow?,1
You can have a ride on Bessie if you like.,1
And Katie was thrilled.,0
"What a clever mother I have,",1
she thought.,0
I’m sure she did a little magic spell to make that happen.,1
"But in fact, her mother had just dropped a heavy hint to Isis’s mum at the school gate, along the lines of",0
Katie’s always telling me how Isis adores her pony.,1
"I think it’s a stage that every girl goes through, but we really can’t afford one.",1
"On Saturday, as they drove to the Pony Farm, Katie’s mum said:",0
"Remember, don’t use any magic.",1
We don’t want Isis’s mum seeing you doing any spells.,1
"Promise Mum,",1
said Katie who was very excited just to be going riding for the first time.,0
"When they arrived, Isis was already tightening the saddle on Bessie and expertly adjusting the stirrups.",0
She knew all about how the reins and the tackle fitted.,0
"Of course, she herself wore all the smartest riding clothes, including jodhpurs, a trim tweed jacket, and buckled shoes.",0
Katie just had her jeans and trainers.,0
She had to borrow a hard hat from the stable.,0
"Isis lifted her foot into the stirrup, and swung her other leg over the pony.",0
"She looked a perfect picture sitting on top of the dapple-coated Bessie, and Katie could not help feeling a pang of envy.",0
"Isis gave Bessie a little kick, and rode her over to the ring, where she cantered and jumped over some small fences.",0
"When it was Katie’s turn to have a go, Isis said:",0
"Now remember, the most important thing is to let Bessie know that you are the boss.",1
"Horses can smell fear, so be firm.",1
"Katie found it a little bit of a struggle to climb up onto the saddle, but Bessie stood very still for her.",0
Isis said:,0
Don’t slouch.,1
"Hold the reins low, you’re not a cowboy.",1
Give her a gentle kick.,1
"Katie kicked, but Bessie didn’t move.",0
"She knows you’re a beginner,",1
sighed Isis.,0
thought Katie.,0
But I know she will like me.,1
We witches have an affinity with animals.,1
"And she concentrated very hard before saying,",0
Click cluck,1
with the back of her mouth.,0
Bessie started to walk.,0
"After fifteen minutes, and a little coaching from Isis, Katie was already trotting.",0
Isis’s mum said to Katie:,0
She’s a natural.,1
"And at the end of the morning, Katie was really excited and thrilled just to have been on a horse.",0
"After that, Isis often invited Katie to ride Bessie. And Katie helped look after her too.",0
"When nobody was looking, she used just a little magic to clean up the stable, which gave Isis and her more time to brush down Bessie’s coat and to gossip about school.",0
"At half term, Isis and her mum rented a cottage in Cornwall. There was a stable nearby, and they planned to go riding every day.",0
"Isis asked if they could bring Katie too, and her mum gladly agreed, because she knew it would be more fun for her daughter to have a friend with her.",0
"As Katie was packing, her mum said:",0
"Remember Katie, no magic on this holiday.",1
"And Katie promised,",0
Yes mum.,1
No magic.,1
She kissed Solomon goodbye and said:,0
Be a good kittie while I’m away.,1
Leave the mice alone.,1
They have a right to live too you know.,1
"And Solomon rubbed his face against Katie’s, purred, and thought,",0
No chance.,1
I’ll get those pesky mice as soon as you’re gone.,1
"It was a long drive down to Cornwall, but Isis’s car was so comfortable that it was no hardship.",0
"When they were off the motorway, they drove along long country lanes with high hedges on either side.",0
"They were heading upwards, towards the moors.",0
The satnav said:,0
Take the next left,1
and they turned into a little farm.,0
Their cottage was in fact a newly converted barn.,0
"It was extremely comfortable inside, with warm central heating, a huge flat panel TV, and a lovely pink bathroom.",0
Through the windows they could see the old stone farm house and the stables.,0
"The next morning, Katie and Isis went to look at the ponies.",0
They met a stable boy who was leading out a sleek black horse on long elegant legs.,0
"He’s a bit of an aristocrat of a horse,",1
said Katie admiringly.,0
And the boy said:,0
(West Country Accent),0
He took a right fright yesterday afternoon and threw the boss.,1
What spooked him?,1
asked Isis?,0
What else?,1
"asked the boy,",0
But the Beast.,1
The beast?,1
"You’re kidding us,",1
said Isis. But Katie said:,0
I suppose he means the Beast of Bodmin Moor.,1
"That be the one,",1
said the boy.,0
"He’s like a big wild cat,",1
"said Katie,",0
Some people think he’s a puma or a panther that escaped from the zoo.,1
"Your friend’s got the low down,",1
said the boy.,0
"Perhaps you’ll get a look at him yourself, if you’re very unlucky...",1
Isis turned her nose up at him.,0
She did not want to admit that he had got her rather spooked herself.,0
"But most people think it’s just a rumour ,and the Beast doesn’t exist,",1
whispered Katie when he was out of earshot.,0
So he was probably just making it up to frighten us any way.,1
They went inside the stable and found a girl who told them that the lad was always making up stories to scare the visitors.,0
"He should be sacked,",1
she said.,0
"Only, he’s the boss’s nephew.",1
And it’s not true.,1
"Nobody was thrown off yesterday, especially not the boss, who isn’t even here this week.",1
"She found them two ponies, one called Yorkie who was black, and another called Steptoe who was brown with a shaggy mane and looked a little bit like a miniature carthorse.",0
"As Isis was the more experienced rider of the two girls, she took Yorkie who was the most frisky of the two ponies.",0
Isis’s mum would have the tall black horse.,0
"That afternoon, they set out on their first trek.",0
They rode up to a lake where their ponies waded in for a drink.,0
Over the next few days they explored the local paths and trails.,0
It was not far from the farm before they were away from the hedges and long grass and up on more stony desolate country.,0
"They rode to an old deserted prison, which was rather spooky.",0
"Katie managed a few canters, and Isis’s pony jumped over a ditch.",0
"When they got back to the farm, they played hide and seek in the hay loft and watched DVDs on TV. Isis’s mum drove into the village to fetch takeaway dinners, and Katie tried Chinese food and learned how to use chop sticks.",0
All in all it was a perfect holiday.,0
"On Friday, they took a packed lunch and rode out on an extra long trek.",0
It was their aim to reach some ancient stones left on the moors by Druids centuries ago.,0
"The sun was shining brightly for the time of the year, and it was a crisp bright day.",0
"A bold fox sat on a stone wall and watched them approach, before slowly jumping down and trotting off to the woods.",0
Brightly coloured pheasants pecked the grass in the fields.,0
A scarecrow provided a perch for the beady-eyed birds.,0
"Katie’s pony plodded on in his usual docile way, until, quite out of character, he shied back and gave Katie a jolt.",0
Whoa!,1
"she said, what’s got into you?",0
"That’s ok,",1
"she said,",0
he’s gone.,1
"Further up the track ,they found an old deserted farm house.",0
"They rode into the walls of its tumbled-down garden, and were thinking of stopping for lunch when all of a sudden a huge black cat jumped over the wall – only this was no kitty-cat like Solomon – this was the size of a large dog, only much thinner and sleeker.",0
"He was black, with bright yellow eyes, yellow teeth, and a red tongue.",0
He was facing Isis who had her back to the farmhouse...,0
her black pony started to rear and stomp all over the place...,0
"her mum screamed as Isis was flung clear off its back – one of her feet was caught in the stirrup – and oh it looked like it twisted nastily as she fell to the ground – the pony darted round the big cat and ran into the next field, but Isis was left on the ground.",0
Her mum was in near hysterics.,0
She was crying.,0
The cat growled and fixed her with his stare.,0
He looked like he was about to pounce.,0
"Katie, do some magic!",1
screamed Isis .,0
"And Katie, who was already thinking of a spell, shouted",0
Catnip!,1
And then she said:,0
Hey Cat – Don’t hurt my friend!,1
and the cat turned around and said:,0
I don’t mean to!,1
Then why did you scare her pony like that?,1
"asked Katie, with difficulty, because her own pony was fritting around, fairly unsettled, even at a distance.",0
Isis’s mum had stopped screaming and was watching in a amazement as Katie carried on this conversation with the creature...,0
"Well,",1
"said the cat,",0
I wouldn’t have done if I knew you could talk...,1
"Listen, I’m hungry.",1
I don’t suppose you have anything to eat with you do you?,1
"Just a cheese sandwich,",1
"said Katie, starting to take off her back back.",0
"No thanks,",1
said the cat.,0
"Sorry, I’m a vegetarian",1
said Katie.,0
I’m sure you would get better food if you went back to the zoo.,1
"The cat, who was now sitting in front of Katie’s horse, licking his paw, looked up and said:",0
I don’t come from the zoo.,1
I had an owner who kept me secretly in his back garden.,1
"I was in a cage, and he fed me on tins of yucky cat food, so I ran away when he forgot to lock the door.",1
I’ve lived up here for the past few years.,1
"I catch rabbits and pheasants, but I don’t like the cold or the rain.",1
"Whenever I try to ask people for help, they get scared and run away.",1
"You’re lucky a farmer hasn’t shot you,",1
said Katie.,0
That will happen one day you know.,1
"Hey, why don’t you let us take you to the zoo?",1
I’m sure they will look after you.,1
"And since Katie seemed like such a nice girl, and so trustworthy, the cat agreed to go back to the farm with them.",0
"Isis’s leg really hurt, and it was with much difficulty that her mum helped her back onto her pony, but it was either that or call the air ambulance, and Isis didn’t fancy flying in a helicopter which would be really noisy and uncomfortable.",0
"The Beast of Bodmin followed them back to the farm, trotting behind the horses,  and when they saw the stable boy Katie called out:",0
Hey have you got any legs of lamb in the freezer.,1
We’ve got a hungry Beast here.,1
"said the boy, and legged it for the farm house as fast as he could.",0
The Beast stayed with Katie while Isis went to the hospital with her mum.,0
"They both promised not to breathe a word to anybody about the magic that they had witnessed, not even to Katie’s mum.",0
"Katie gave him a pint of milk, a pot of cream, and some leftovers of duck in plum sauce.",0
"I’m sure they will have steak in the zoo,",1
she promised.,0
"And the Beast of  Bodmin purred contentedly, because although he was hungry, he was at least warm by the radiator and looking forward to his new life in the enclosure, where food would be brought to him, and visitors would admire him.",0
And that was the story of Katie and the Pony who was spooked.,0
Andromeda was tied to a rock by her parents and left for a sea-monster to eat for his breakfast.,0
"Not surprisingly, she wasn’t very pleased about that.",0
"She tells us in her own voice how this came about, and how she was rescued by the Greek Hero, Perseus. We then hear Perseus’ life story, including the tale of how he cut off the snaky head of the Gorgon Medusa. That really did happen to me - and do you know what?",0
My own parents chained me to that rock.,0
"Yes, my mother and father!",0
I thought they loved me!,0
My mother was always boasting about me.,0
She told anyone who would listen that I was more beautiful than the sea nymphs called the Nereids – I’m not saying that it wasn’t true – but you just can’t say that sort of thing.,0
It’s called blasphemy.,0
"The Nereids are immortal, and they have a god-given right to claim the title for anything they want,  including the most beautiful.",0
"But I was young, and I didn’t know that.",0
The thing that really irked me was their plan to marry me off to my uncle.,0
If it wasn’t bad enough that he was middle aged and ugly and my father’s brother – he was also – would you believe it – a pirate.,0
"His ghastly crews of cutthroats were menacing our ports, and he said they would do worse still if I could not be his bride.",0
So Mum and Dad caved in without even asking my opinion.,0
"The wedding date was fixed, and invitations went out with a little ode by the court bard comparing me to the Nereids and saying that I topped them in the looks department.",0
They even sent one of these little ditties to Poseidon the God of the Sea – well known for his stormy temper – and the proud father of the aforementioned Nereids. What a mistake that was!,0
"He didn’t just stir up the waves, he puked up a foul monster that came to ravage our coast.",0
His priestess told my parents that the monster would not pull back until it had yours truly as a sacrificial breakfast.,0
So now you know how I found myself in that rather nasty predicament chained to the rock.,0
"If that wasn’t irksome enough, there was the court painter up on the cliffs, recording the very first impression of Andromeda and the Sea Monster for mythology.",0
"I don’t know if I was more terrified, or more furious with my parents.",0
I thought I would never see my seventeenth birthday.,0
"As I mentioned, the sea monster was dragging things out – I think he enjoyed the drama of it all.",0
The crowds of spectators were going to get their money’s worth – but that was his big mistake.,0
I looked up to the sky to call out:,0
"""Oh Zeus, Lord of the Heavens, send me deliverance from this foul beast and these dumb parents of mine!"" And who says that prayer has no power – because, out of the clouds, there appeared a strange bird.",0
I saw right away that this was something out of the ordinary;,0
he seemed more upright in the air than a normal feathered friend.,0
"I can’t say he swooped like an Eagle, at times it looked more like he was tossed by the winds – a real amateur flyer.",0
But then he gained more control and started to streak towards us.,0
"I could see now that this creature of the air was equipped with a shield, a sword, and a helmet.",0
His wings were on his feet – which accounted for his strange style of flying.,0
He was encumbered by a sort of rucksack on his back.,0
I held my breath.,0
I was surely saved.,0
Here was a god or a hero and he was going to use his sword to slice up that foul serpent of the sea.,0
But oh – what an idiot!,0
"Instead of coming to save me, he plonked himself down on the ground right by my parents.",0
I learned later that he was demanding my hand in marriage in return for rescuing me.,0
"My father, as was his annoying way, was bargaining with him for a better deal.",0
I took a deep breath and called out:,0
"""Come on!",0
"If you are going to save me, get on with it!"" At which point, the winged hero finally got the idea that time was of the essence.",0
"He did his thing, and fluttered above the beast with his sword, swiping this way and that, until he finally struck home and kebabbed it through the neck.",0
That night we ate fried sea serpent on the beach.,0
So I learned the name of my hero.,0
"He called himself Perseus, son of Zeus. I must admit, he was an improvement on my previous fiance.",0
"At least he was young and handsome, even if he was an incompetent flyer, and he liked the sound of his own voice a bit too much.",0
"He sat talking to my father about the politics of heaven and earth, and all his divine relatives, and all his heroic deeds and adventures.",0
"One thing I noticed was he never seemed to leave his rucksack, which was made out of goatskin, far from his sight.",0
"When he put it down on the beach, all the seaweed immediately turned to coral.",0
Whatever was inside it had some pretty powerful magic.,0
When eventually he sat down next to me I asked:,0
So what brought you here Perseus?,1
"The winds,",1
he said.,0
Or perhaps fate.,1
My life has always been like that.,1
"When I was a baby, my father put me in a crate with my mother and dropped us into the Aegean Sea.",1
Aren’t parents wonderful?,1
I commented.,0
Well he had his reasons.,1
"An oracle told him that I was fated to kill him,",1
he explained.,0
"For five days my mother and I were the playthings of the winds, tossed by the waves this way and that.",1
Eventually we washed up with the flotsam and jetsam on the shore of the island of Seriphos where we were discovered by a fisherman.,1
He brought us to King Polydectes who took us into his palace and looked after us.,1
"The only problem was, see, he fancied my mother, the beautiful Danae, the bride of Zeus. He came to her as a shower of golden rain.",1
"As Zeus does,",1
I said.,0
"As time went by, and I grew older, Polydectes resented me more and more.",0
He thought that I was keeping my mother from him.,0
"So when it was his birthday, he came up with a wheeze to get me out of the way.",0
I asked him what he wanted as a present – and he replied:,0
The head of the Gorgon Medusa.,1
The head of who?,1
"Medusa. She was once a beautiful woman, but she too found a way to anger the gods by violating the temple of Athena. The vengeful goddess gave Medusa the worst hair day in all of history.",1
"She made her head full of snakes – hissing, spitting and writhing.",1
She is so terrifying to behold that any man who looks at her immediately turns into stone.,1
She is quite literally petrifying.,1
And women?,1
I asked.,0
I do not know.,1
I believe it is men who fear the head of Medusa most.,1
"Well that’s quite a quest,",1
I said.,0
I wish you luck with it.,1
"I thought perhaps that when he next flew off, he would never come back.",0
"It was a pity, because as I said, he was a nice looking chap.",0
He had muscles alright.,0
"But we did not have time to chat more because who should turn up then, but the most annoying man in my life – and that’s saying something – Uncle Phineus, the pirate who thought he had a right to marry his own niece.",0
Well now I had a protector who would show him.,0
There was only one problem.,0
My uncle had a whole army with him.,0
"When my uncle and would-be husband saw Perseus sitting cosily close up to me, his eyes blazed with fury.",0
He raised his spear ready to throw it at my body.,0
That wasn’t nice.,0
My father stood up and called out:,0
"""Brother, what are you doing?",0
Perseus has won the right to marry my daughter.,0
Do not blame him for losing your bride.,0
"It was Poseidon who meant to take her away from all of us by sending his sea serpent to devour her."" Phineus had a hot temper, however, and would hear none of it.",0
He threw his spear and missed.,0
Perseus would have returned it with interest – but my uncle sought divine protection by diving behind the altar of Bacchus. Then there broke out an almighty brawl between Phineus’ army of pirates and my father’s body guards.,0
"Perseus was active too, cutting down pirates right and left with his sword, but it was clear that our side of the family was heavily outnumbered.",0
"When things were looking bad for us, Perseus picked up his goatskin sack.",0
I thought,0
"Uh oh, he’s off, preparing to make his getaway,",1
but now I know that Perseus is not one to flee from a fight.,0
He called out:,0
"Our side, all look away – Now!",1
"And turning his own head away, he reached inside the bag and pulled out the head of Medusa. I could look at it because I am a girl, and we women are not so easily petrified by revolting stuff as men are.",0
It was truly hideous – more so than that sea monster.,0
It was the combination of a pale but beautiful face and those foul snakes.,0
"They made my blood run cold, but I did not turn to stone.",0
"The pirates of Phineus however, all instantly became statues.",0
My uncle had managed to look away at the last moment and was shielding his eyes with his sleeve.,0
Now he started to plead:,0
Perseus. You are the rightful husband of Andromeda. I acknowledge that I was wrong to attack you.,1
Show mercy.,1
Spare me.,1
But my fiance called back:,0
You shall not suffer the sword.,1
"I will cause you to be an enduring monument through the ages, and you will always be seen in my father-in-law’s palace.",1
He walked over to where Phineus was hiding and dangled the snakes over his face – and he too turned into a statue.,0
"A well deserved fate, I say.",0
By now I realised that Perseus had already completed his mission to cut off the Gorgon’s head.,0
He told me how Athena had given him the equipment he needed for the deed.,0
"She provided him with the shiny shield, and told him to look only at Medusa’s reflection, not at her directly.",0
She gave him too the divine sword with which to cut off her horrid head.,0
"And Hermes, the messenger of the gods, provided him with the winged sandals and a cap of invisibility.",0
It was a pity he didn’t give him a flying lesson too while he was about it.,0
"The main problem was that Perseus did not know where on earth to find the Gorgon ladies and Medusa. First off he flew to the lands of the snowy north, where days are short and the skies are dirty.",0
"There, in a damp and chilly cave, he found the three grey sisters who share one eye between them.",0
"They were relatives of Medusa, and surely knew where she lurked, but they were loath to betray their kith and kin.",0
"Perseus was quick and cunning, and as they passed the eye between them, sister to sister, he slipped in his hand and took it off them.",0
Now the grey sisters were beside themselves:,0
Return our eye you Greek thief!,1
they raged.,0
"Ah-ah, not until you tell me what I want to know.",1
he declared.,0
"Eventually the grey ones had no choice but to give him directions to the land of the Gorgons, way to the south, where Medusa could be found.",0
"So armed with this knowledge, Perseus took flight once again.",0
"He flew down south to the lands that are hot and sandy, and discovered the temple of the serpent-headed Gorgon. He could hear the hissing of her snakes as her head lay on a grassy knoll.",0
"Stepping backwards, guided only by the reflection of his shield, he crept up on tiptoe holding his divine sword.",0
"It was with one swift swish that he cut off her head and bagged it in the goatskin knapsack that was on loan from Hermes, and through which snakes could not bite.",0
"So that was how Perseus collected the snaky head of Medusa. He flew off for home, his wings beating the gentle air.",0
"As he passed over Libya, the Gorgon’s blood dripped from his bag and landed on the desert sand.",0
Ever since then it has been a place beset by snakes.,0
As he reached the coast the winds began to blow – he was at their mercy – carried this way and that – just as he had been as a baby on the waves of the sea.,0
A current of air lifted him high into the sky and tossed him down onto the edge of the world – the place where the giant Atlas lives.,0
"Now Atlas' jealously guarded his orchard, the garden of the Hesperides, where golden apples grew on the trees.",0
The suspicious strong man suspected that the son of Zeus had come to steal his precious fruit.,0
"Giant as he was, he thought that no puny man could defeat him – how could he?",0
And he came to thump Perseus and drive him down into the Underworld. But he did not reckon on the hero’s secret weapon.,0
Perseus pulled the beastly snakehead out of his goatskin knapsack.,0
Medusa’s face petrified Atlas. His hair and beard became trees.,0
His hulking body turned into the rock and earth of a mountain.,0
His head was its summit.,0
He grew into an immense height and the whole sky with its many stars rested on him.,0
"Now, and forevermore, it is the body that was once Atlas that holds up the top of the world.",0
"The storm had settled, and Perseus could resume his journey, but he was so blown off course that he did not know where he was.",0
That is how he found himself drifting over the rock to which I was chained.,0
It was chance that brought him to me.,0
"But no, nothing is chance.",0
The gods meant it to be.,0
It was fate.,0
"The day after the fight with the pirates, I was married to Perseus. I must say I was content.",0
"We were, after all, a handsome couple, matched in beauty, but not in brains.",0
"I, of course, was ten times as smart as he was.",0
"A few weeks of near perfection passed and then, one morning, he said to me:",0
My darling Andromeda. It is high time you met my mother.,1
"Now girls, just so you know, this is something that all men get round to saying sooner or later.",0
It’s just something you have to go through.,0
"But she lives far across the sea,",1
"I protested,",0
How are we going to get to her place?,1
he said.,0
"If you think I’m hitching a lift on your back while you flutter around on those winged sandals, you’ve got another thing coming.",0
No thank you.,0
"I’m a ground-loving girl."" Perseus was quite naturally put out by this speech – but I mean, did he really think I was going to entrust myself to what he called 'the winds of fate?' No way!",0
But a few days later he came back with a more acceptable idea.,0
"When he killed Medusa, apparently a winged horse called Pegasus had hopped out of her neck.",0
"He had done a bit of private praying to his half-sister Athena, and she told Pegasus to hop over the seas, and to pick us up and carry us back to his home.",0
"Yes, that was the way to fly!",0
What a journey!,0
"The two of us on that magnificent, brilliant white horse with a proper wing span that could beat the air and carry us smoothly above all the turbulence.",0
"The sea below us, the sky above – all stretched out and curved at the edges – just like it was there for us and only us.",0
I could see ships and dolphins and shimmering waves feathered with white surf.,0
Golden sunset.,0
Silvery moon.,0
Rosy dawn – it was just like we were Gods!,0
"When we reached the Island of Seriphos, we went straight to the palace to meet the king.",0
Welcome back Percy,1
he said patronisingly.,0
I for one don’t like that nickname and always call him Perseus.,0
I see you’ve gotten yourself a fine horse and a pretty bride.,1
But what have you brought me?,1
The Gorgon’s head proved too much for you eh?,1
Though you be son of Zeus.,1
"Behold,",1
"said Perseus, extracting the hideous thing from his bag.",0
"The king beheld his birthday gift, the head of Medusa, and he turned to stone.",0
"Next I met my husband’s mother, Danae. He had not exaggerated.",0
She was indeed a true beauty and a fitting bride for Zeus. Perseus then had to see another important woman in his life – his half-sister Athena. He returned the shield and the sword to her.,0
"He also gave her Medusa’s head, which she affixed to her shield, so that all her enemies would be petrified.",0
"Hermes took back his winged sandals – good riddance to them I say, and his goatskin bag.",0
Perseus was still my hero.,0
"Beautiful, strong, a bit thick.",0
That is not quite the end of the story.,0
"A few years later, he took part in some athletic games.",0
"It was, after all, something he was good at.",0
"He was about to win the javelin contest, throwing his spear to its target well and true.",0
"But at that moment and old man, in a bit of a daze, stepped into its path.",0
He was killed instantly.,0
So the life of Perseus was again determined by fate.,0
"He had killed his father, King Zeus, who all those years before had set him and his mother adrift in a crate on the seas.",0
And what became of me?,0
"Well I was a mortal, and so after many years, it was my fate to die.",0
"But as I was the wife of a hero and a demigod, Perseus decided to honour me.",0
"He turned me into a constellation called, naturally enough, Andromeda. My mother, my father, the winged horse Pegasus, and that beastly sea monster are all up here with me.",0
Perseus is a bit further away.,0
What’s it like being a constellation?,0
"Well life up here is pretty glitzy, as you can imagine.",0
We have everything we need to sparkle and shine and look beautiful.,0
We have wonderful views of the planets and the infinite majesty of space.,0
"But oh yes, I do miss the warmth of human blood in my veins, and the embrace of my hero, Perseus. And that was the story of Andromeda and Perseus, from Greek mythology.",0
"Bertie’s asked me to tell you, in case you don’t know, that the word 'petrified' can mean both terrified and 'turned to stone'.",0
"It comes from the Greek word 'petros', meaning rock.",0
"The name Peter also means 'rock' and in the Bible, Jesus calls Peter 'the rock' of the church.",0
So now you know!,0
Storynory listeners know that the Wicked Queen turned Bertie into a frog.,0
But the secret is not yet out in the Big Wide World. There's a rumour that the Queen has recorded her confessions on a cassette tape.,0
The tape has gone missing.,0
The race is on to find it.,0
Bertie MUST get hold of it first.,0
A slightly silly Bertie adventure read by Natasha...,0
"and written by Bertie. Bertie and the Queen’s Confession. Hello, this is Natasha And I’m here with the latest news from the pond where Prince Bertie the frog lives.",0
"As you may know, Bertie is a very patient frog.",0
He has been waiting simply ages for the Lovely Princess Beatrice to twig who he really is.,0
"Yes Beatrice, Your Royal Highness, that cool and trendy frog who lives on the Palace Pond is your long lost prince !",0
"I tried to tell her once, but she thought that I was a loony who had climbed over the palace wall.",0
She called the guards and had me thrown out!,0
If only she listened to Storynory !,0
"Well, you listen to Storynory, so you know the secret about Bertie. But some people are a bit slow, I mean, you would think that the BBC or the newspapers would have got hold of the story by now !",0
Tim the Tadpole thinks that Bertie’s life would make a great Hollywood Movie....,0
"and when that happens, I want a part in it.",0
Perhaps I’ll be Sadie the Swan - what do you think?,0
"Only last week, a news reporter came in secret to speak to Beatrice. They took a walk past the palace pond, where nobody would hear them.",0
"Nobody, except for a royal frog, a grumpy carp, a haughty swan, twenty geese, forty ducklings, and two thousand tadpoles !",0
"Oh, and I heard them too, because I was reading a book under a tree.",0
"They didn’t even see me, because they were talking so intently.",0
"Beatrice was saying,",0
I really really shouldn’t tell you anything.,1
I could get into SO much trouble with the press officer at the palace.,1
"And the journalist replied,",0
"But your Royal Highness, our newspaper will help you find Prince Bertie. My reporter’s nose tells me I’m really onto something.",1
What exactly have you found out about Bertie?,1
"asked Beatrice, hesitantly.",0
She looked white and worried.,0
Do you know...,1
do you know if he’s alive?,1
"Her big blue eyes fluttered, and even the reporter was touched.",0
The pond was unusually quiet.,0
Not a single duckling peeped.,0
All the creatures were listening intently - not least Bertie himself.,0
"I’m afraid I don’t know if Prince Bertie is alive, your loveliness, I mean your highness, but I’ve heard rumours....",1
I mean to say...,1
have you heard anything?,1
she said.,0
Not a dicky bird.,1
"Please tell me, what is it that you’ve heard?",1
I must know the truth.,1
"It’s just a rumour,",1
"said the reporter,",0
"But people say that the Wicked, I mean, Her Majesty the Queen, has lost something important.",1
Well placed people inside the palace tell me that she’s in a frightful fluster.,1
Is that so?,1
"Oh yes,",1
"said Beatrice,",0
My stepmother has been acting very strangely this past two weeks.,1
She sacked her maid.,1
She even accused me of sneaking into her room and stealing her...,1
her something - but I didn’t even know what she was talking about.,1
Was it a cassette by any chance?,1
Yes that was it.,1
What’s a cassette?,1
I’ve really no idea.,1
A cassette is something we used back in the olden days.,0
It’s a tape.,0
"You can record sounds on it, like music, or voices.",0
"Before people had iPhones, and Androids, and iPods, we used cassette players - Walkmans we called them ...",0
"said Beatrice,",0
The Queen is a bit stuck in her ways..,1
I suppose she might use an old thing like that.,1
But why is it so important?,1
I don’t think she listens to music.,1
Well the rumor goes that she recorded her confessions on it.,1
That’s why she’s so worried.,1
"At this point, I heard a little squeaky voice from the pond say,",0
"Bertie, What’s a confession?",1
And several fish told him to ‘SHHHHHHH!’.,0
"But Bertie whispered back,",0
It’s very interesting Tim. A confession would be when she says all the bad things she’s done...,1
Even little Tim understood that the Wicked Queen’s Confession would make a gripping tale.,0
"But Beatrice - well she likes to think the best of everyone, even of her stepmother.",0
She looked all blue-eyed and innocent and asked:,0
But what has my Stepmother got to confess?,1
The reporter sighed.,0
"Well,",1
"he said,",0
the truth about what happened to Bertie...,1
"At that point, they walked out of earshot, but Bertie was hopping up and down with excitement.",0
"The Cassette, the cassette, we’ve got to get hold of the Cassette !",1
Then everyone will know the truth.,1
Natasha can podcast it to the world !,1
The Wicked Queen will be condemned out of her own mouth!,1
"And all the pond-life were again a flutter, and flapping and quacking as excitedly as if the palace baker had just thrown a basket of stale buns into the water.",0
"Bertie called a meeting, and everyone agreed to help him The sparrows and thrushes and all the birds on Twitter were straight on the case.",0
They kept their beady eyes on the look out for a little box with tape inside it.,0
The garden magpie swore that he hadn’t stolen it.,0
And the Palace mice promised to check out every nook-hole.,0
"But a week went past, and there was no news of the tape.",0
"Oh well,",1
"sighed Bertie,",0
I expected it got recycled.,1
It’s probably been made into a plastic drinks bottle by now.,1
"But on Saturday night, there was a dramatic development.",0
"When it was getting dark, the Wicked Queen herself came down to the pond, which was highly unusual, and rather scary.",0
Bertie hid under a stone in case she planned to do something even worse to him.,0
"But Sadie the Swan could see that she was worried, by the way she was ringing her hands and pacing up and down.",0
Then a man’s heavy footsteps crunched down the path to the pond.,0
Bertie peaked out of the water and said :,0
"I know him, that’s Fred the Footman.",1
"Well,",1
"said the Queen, when Fred arrived,",0
"This had better be good, or I’ll turn you into a toad!",1
"Oh, it is good,",1
"chuckled Fred,",0
It’s the story of your life.,1
"Every night, for the past two weeks, I’ve listened to a chapter at bedtime, and what a tale !",1
"Fascinating, your majesty.",1
One of the best crime stories ever !,1
You filthy son of a flea !,1
screeched the Queen.,0
Give me back my cassette!,1
"Tish tish, I think I deserve a handsome reward for finding a thing like that, don’t you?’ ",0
Reward!,1
You stole it !,1
The newspapers will pay a high price ....,1
"All right, all right, one bar of gold..",1
"Ten bars of gold, sent to my Swiss Bank...:",1
GRRRRR!,1
The Queen was still gnashing her teeth when Bertie started to hop as fast as he could across the palace garden.,0
"You see, he had known Fred all his life.",0
"When he was a boy, Fred showed him his secret hideaway.",0
Bertie was sure that was where he would store the cassette.....,0
Fred always wanted to be a famous singer-songwriter.,0
"He had a little shed in the woods, where he used to strum his guitar, sing his songs, and record himself.",0
He had loads of vintage recording equipment because he swore that it sounded better than the modern stuff.,0
"He had a big quarter inch tape player called a Revox, and he had...",0
a compact-cassette player !,0
Sadie the Swan saw Bertie and she took off from the pond with her black wings going whoosh whoosh whoosh!,0
She flew through the moonlit night to the woods where she waited for Bertie.,0
"to Fred’s hut,",1
panted Bertie. Sadie had never seen him look so determined.,0
Bertie knew that this was his best chance yet to reveal the truth to the world - the truth about how the Wicked Queen Turned him into a frog...,0
.he could hear the church bells ringing...,0
he could hear the crowds shout,0
Long Live Bertie and Beatrice!,1
he could feel her warm kiss....,0
he could taste - yes Chocolate Cake....,0
their wedding cake would be one hundred% pure organic fair trade chocolate (Beatrice would insist on the organic fair trade bit).,0
"Bertie hopped on through the tangled undergrowth of the woods, trying to avoid the stinging nettles.",0
Sadie waddled along side him.,0
They reached Fred’s hut.,0
Locked!,1
"sighed Sadie, as she looked up at the chain and the padlock on the door.",0
"Of course,",1
"said Bertie,",0
But there’s a loose plank around the back.,1
Or there used to be.,1
Fred’s cat used to slink in through it.,1
"Thankfully, some things never change.",0
"The cat flap was still open, and there was plenty of room for a frog to slip inside.",0
Sadie stayed outside and looked out for trouble.,0
All was still.,0
She saw nothing.,0
Then suddenly she heard a voice:,0
"Hello, This is Queen Hilda, and I’m dropping by with the thrilling story of my life.",1
Sadie hissed and flapped her wings...,0
she was ready for a fight to the death....,0
but there was no sound of a struggle from within the hut...,0
the voice rambled on...,0
My tale will reveal all:,0
the true story all my wonderfully wicked deeds.,0
Here’s a few little tasters:,0
When I was a baby I made a burp so big it blew down a house.,0
"When I was five years old, I made Santa fall asleep and miss Christmas Day. At school, I made it rain every sports day for ten years in a row.",0
"Later on, I put a spell on that that old fool, my husband, so that he would marry me.",0
"And you’ve heard the rumours - yes it’s true, I confess it freely !",0
I turned that nincompoop Prince Bertie into a frog.,0
You would have done the same too if he wanted to marry your stepdaughter !,0
But I rush ahead of myself.,0
We’ll save the best for last.,0
"By now, Sadie realised that Bertie had found the cassette tape of the queen’s confessions and was playing it....",0
but they didn’t have all night - Sadie stuck her beak through the loose plank and hissed:,0
Come on Bertie. We can’t wait for Fred to turn up...Bring the cassette and we’ll hide it well...,1
"Bertie jumped onto a button of the player, and ejected the cassette.",0
He came out of the hut out with it in his mouth.,0
They headed back for the pond as fast as they could hop and waddle.,0
"But when they emerged from the woods, they saw a pair of emerald green eyes glowing across the lawn:",0
Is that Fred’s cat?,1
asked Sadie.,0
said Bertie.,0
I would know those eyes anywhere.,1
They belong to the Wicked Queen.,1
It was too late.,0
"The Queen is a witch, and she has perfect night vision.",0
"She spotted them right away, and she screeched:",0
Bertie !,1
Halt Right There!,1
"Quick, give me the tape!",1
"hissed Sadie, and she pecked it from Bertie’s mouth with her beak.",0
Hey what are you doing!,1
said Bertie as Sadie started to run and flap her swooshing wings.,0
A few seconds later her feat were off the ground and she was starting to climb upwards towards the moon with the tape still firmly in her beak.,0
But the Wicked Queen was not about to see her life memoirs get away like that.,0
She turned herself into an eagle and started to fly after her.,0
All Bertie could do was watch helplessly.,0
He looked up at the moon and saw the dark silhouettes of a swan and an eagle in a furious battle.,0
Sadie zig-zagged to escape the eagle.,0
The eagle snapped furiously at her tale fathers.,0
Soon she had grabbed hold of the swan with her talons.,0
Sadie turned round her powerful neck and stabbed with her beak at the eagle...,0
"there were terrible screeches - from the eagle, or the swan, or both..",0
.Bertie could not tell.,0
"But oh, Sadie let go of the cassette, and down it fell.....it was broken and the silvery tape glistened in the moonlight as it tumbled and tangled....",0
"down down down until with a plop, the box fell into the pond, and the tape floated in a knot on the water.",0
"The Eagle dived down after it, but but when she reached the surface of the pond, a furious carp left out and slapped her around the face with his tale...",0
not even an eagle...not even the Wicked Queen in the form of an Eagle - would tangle with Colin the Carp when he was in a fury.,0
"In any case, the tape was wet, tangled, and ruined.",0
She flapped off back to her palace.,0
"And so nobody, except for Fred and the the Wicked Queen, knows exactly what the rest of the tape revealed.",0
Nobody was quite sure why the Queen recorded her Confession - perhaps she had done a deal to sell her memoirs for millions - But some of the tangled tape has made its way into the duck nests on the pond - and the tadpoles play tug of war and loop the loop with the rest of it.,0
"The cassette box has sunk to the bottom, where it lies under a stone, empty and forgotten.",0
And that was the story of Bertie and the Queen’s Confession. Ooohhh What a truly Wicked Queen she is !,0
"Poor Bertie. I’m not so sure I’m sorry for Beatrice though, after she had me thrown out of the palace.",0
"Anyway, it’s good to have Bertie round for the time being, because he has so many stories, and you can always drop by to hear them, at Storynory.com.",0
"For now, from me, Natasha Bye bye!",0
